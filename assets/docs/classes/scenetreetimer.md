## Brief

One-shot timer.

## Description

A one-shot timer managed by the scene tree, which emits `timeout` on completion. See also `SceneTree.create_timer`.
As opposed to `Timer`, it does not require the instantiation of a node. Commonly used to create a one-shot delay timer as in the following example:

```gdscript
        func some_function():
            print("Timer started.")
            await get_tree().create_timer(1.0).timeout
            print("Timer ended.")

```

```csharp
        public async Task SomeFunction()
        {
            GD.Print("Timer started.");
            await ToSignal(GetTree().CreateTimer(1.0f), SceneTreeTimer.SignalName.Timeout);
            GD.Print("Timer ended.");
        }

```

The timer will be dereferenced after its time elapses. To preserve the timer, you can keep a reference to it. See `RefCounted`.
**Note:** The timer is processed after all of the nodes in the current frame, i.e. node's `Node._process` method would be called before the timer (or `Node._physics_process` if `process_in_physics` in `SceneTree.create_timer` has been set to `true`).

## Properties

> property time_left : float ; setter=set_time_left ; getter=get_time_left

The time remaining (in seconds).

## Signals

> signal timeout()

Emitted when the timer reaches 0.
