# SkeletonModification2D

> class SkeletonModification2D ; experimental=This class may be changed or removed in future versions.
> inherits SkeletonModification2D Resource

## Brief

Base class for resources that operate on `Bone2D`s in a `Skeleton2D`.

## Description

This resource provides an interface that can be expanded so code that operates on `Bone2D` nodes in a `Skeleton2D` can be mixed and matched together to create complex interactions.
This is used to provide Godot with a flexible and powerful Inverse Kinematics solution that can be adapted for many different uses.

## Properties

> property enabled : bool ; default=true ; setter=set_enabled ; getter=get_enabled

If `true`, the modification's `_execute` function will be called by the `SkeletonModificationStack2D`.

> property execution_mode : int ; default=0 ; setter=set_execution_mode ; getter=get_execution_mode

The execution mode for the modification. This tells the modification stack when to execute the modification. Some modifications have settings that are only available in certain execution modes.

## Methods

> method _draw_editor_gizmo() -> void ; qualifiers=virtual

Used for drawing **editor-only** modification gizmos. This function will only be called in the Godot editor and can be overridden to draw custom gizmos.
**Note:** You will need to use the Skeleton2D from `SkeletonModificationStack2D.get_skeleton` and it's draw functions, as the `SkeletonModification2D` resource cannot draw on its own.

> method _execute(delta: float) -> void ; qualifiers=virtual

Executes the given modification. This is where the modification performs whatever function it is designed to do.

> method _setup_modification(modification_stack: SkeletonModificationStack2D) -> void ; qualifiers=virtual

Called when the modification is setup. This is where the modification performs initialization.

> method clamp_angle(angle: float, min: float, max: float, invert: bool) -> float

Takes an angle and clamps it so it is within the passed-in `min` and `max` range. `invert` will inversely clamp the angle, clamping it to the range outside of the given bounds.

> method get_editor_draw_gizmo() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns whether this modification will call `_draw_editor_gizmo` in the Godot editor to draw modification-specific gizmos.

> method get_is_setup() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns whether this modification has been successfully setup or not.

> method get_modification_stack() -> SkeletonModificationStack2D

Returns the `SkeletonModificationStack2D` that this modification is bound to. Through the modification stack, you can access the Skeleton2D the modification is operating on.

> method set_editor_draw_gizmo(draw_gizmo: bool) -> void

Sets whether this modification will call `_draw_editor_gizmo` in the Godot editor to draw modification-specific gizmos.

> method set_is_setup(is_setup: bool) -> void

Manually allows you to set the setup state of the modification. This function should only rarely be used, as the `SkeletonModificationStack2D` the modification is bound to should handle setting the modification up.
