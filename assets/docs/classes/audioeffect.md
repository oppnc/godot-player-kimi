# AudioEffect

> class AudioEffect
> inherits AudioEffect Resource

## Brief

Base class for audio effect resources.

## Description

The base `Resource` for every audio effect. In the editor, an audio effect can be added to the current bus layout through the Audio panel. At run-time, it is also possible to manipulate audio effects through `AudioServer.add_bus_effect`, `AudioServer.remove_bus_effect`, and `AudioServer.get_bus_effect`.
When applied on a bus, an audio effect creates a corresponding `AudioEffectInstance`. The instance is directly responsible for manipulating sound, based on the original audio effect's properties.

## Methods

> method _instantiate() -> AudioEffectInstance ; qualifiers=virtual required

Override this method to customize the `AudioEffectInstance` created when this effect is applied on a bus in the editor's Audio panel, or through `AudioServer.add_bus_effect`.

```text
                extends AudioEffect

                @export var strength = 4.0

                func _instantiate():
                    var effect = CustomAudioEffectInstance.new()
                    effect.base = self

                    return effect

```

**Note:** It is recommended to keep a reference to the original `AudioEffect` in the new instance. Depending on the implementation this allows the effect instance to listen for changes at run-time and be modified accordingly.
