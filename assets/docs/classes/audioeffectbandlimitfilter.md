# AudioEffectBandLimitFilter

> class AudioEffectBandLimitFilter
> inherits AudioEffectBandLimitFilter AudioEffectFilter

## Brief

Adds a band-limit filter to an audio bus.

## Description

A "band-limit" filter attenuates the frequencies at `AudioEffectFilter.cutoff_hz`, and allows frequencies outside the frequency threshold to pass unchanged. It is a wider and weaker version of `AudioEffectNotchFilter`, and is the opposite of `AudioEffectBandPassFilter`.
This filter can be used to give more room for other sounds to play at that frequency.
