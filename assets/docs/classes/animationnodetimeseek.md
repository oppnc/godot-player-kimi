# AnimationNodeTimeSeek

> class AnimationNodeTimeSeek
> inherits AnimationNodeTimeSeek AnimationNode

## Brief

A time-seeking animation node used in `AnimationTree`.

## Description

This animation node can be used to cause a seek command to happen to any sub-children of the animation graph. Use to play an `Animation` from the start or a certain playback position inside the `AnimationNodeBlendTree`.
After setting the time and changing the animation playback, the time seek node automatically goes into sleep mode on the next process frame by setting its `seek_request` value to `-1.0`.

```gdscript
        # Play child animation from the start.
        animation_tree.set("parameters/TimeSeek/seek_request", 0.0)
        # Alternative syntax (same result as above).
        animation_tree["parameters/TimeSeek/seek_request"] = 0.0

        # Play child animation from 12 second timestamp.
        animation_tree.set("parameters/TimeSeek/seek_request", 12.0)
        # Alternative syntax (same result as above).
        animation_tree["parameters/TimeSeek/seek_request"] = 12.0

```

```csharp
        // Play child animation from the start.
        animationTree.Set("parameters/TimeSeek/seek_request", 0.0);

        // Play child animation from 12 second timestamp.
        animationTree.Set("parameters/TimeSeek/seek_request", 12.0);

```

## Properties

> property explicit_elapse : bool ; default=true ; setter=set_explicit_elapse ; getter=is_explicit_elapse

If `true`, some processes are executed to handle keys between seeks, such as calculating root motion and finding the nearest discrete key.
