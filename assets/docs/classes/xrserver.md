# XRServer

> class XRServer
> inherits XRServer Object

## Brief

Server for AR and VR features.

## Description

The AR/VR server is the heart of our Advanced and Virtual Reality solution and handles all the processing.

## Properties

> property camera_locked_to_origin : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_camera_locked_to_origin ; getter=is_camera_locked_to_origin

If set to `true`, the scene will be rendered as if the camera is locked to the `XROrigin3D`.
**Note:** This doesn't provide a very comfortable experience for users. This setting exists for doing benchmarking or automated testing, where you want to control what is rendered via code.

> property primary_interface : XRInterface ; setter=set_primary_interface ; getter=get_primary_interface

The primary `XRInterface` currently bound to the `XRServer`.

> property world_origin : Transform3D ; default=Transform3D(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0) ; setter=set_world_origin ; getter=get_world_origin

The current origin of our tracking space in the virtual world. This is used by the renderer to properly position the camera with new tracking data.
**Note:** This property is managed by the current `XROrigin3D` node. It is exposed for access from GDExtensions.

> property world_scale : float ; default=1.0 ; setter=set_world_scale ; getter=get_world_scale

The scale of the game world compared to the real world. By default, most AR/VR platforms assume that 1 game unit corresponds to 1 real world meter.

## Methods

> method add_interface(interface: XRInterface) -> void

Registers an `XRInterface` object.

> method add_tracker(tracker: XRTracker) -> void

Registers a new `XRTracker` that tracks a physical object.

> method center_on_hmd(rotation_mode: RotationMode, keep_height: bool) -> void

This is an important function to understand correctly. AR and VR platforms all handle positioning slightly differently.
For platforms that do not offer spatial tracking, our origin point `(0, 0, 0)` is the location of our HMD, but you have little control over the direction the player is facing in the real world.
For platforms that do offer spatial tracking, our origin point depends very much on the system. For OpenVR, our origin point is usually the center of the tracking space, on the ground. For other platforms, it's often the location of the tracking camera.
This method allows you to center your tracker on the location of the HMD. It will take the current location of the HMD and use that to adjust all your tracking data; in essence, realigning the real world to your player's current position in the game world.
For this method to produce usable results, tracking information must be available. This often takes a few frames after starting your game.
You should call this method after a few seconds have passed. For example, when the user requests a realignment of the display holding a designated button on a controller for a short period of time, or when implementing a teleport mechanism.

> method clear_reference_frame() -> void

Clears the reference frame that was set by previous calls to `center_on_hmd`.

> method find_interface(name: String) -> XRInterface ; qualifiers=const

Finds an interface by its `name`. For example, if your project uses capabilities of an AR/VR platform, you can find the interface for that platform by name and initialize it.

> method get_hmd_transform() -> Transform3D

Returns the primary interface's transformation.

> method get_interface(idx: int) -> XRInterface ; qualifiers=const

Returns the interface registered at the given `idx` index in the list of interfaces.

> method get_interface_count() -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the number of interfaces currently registered with the AR/VR server. If your project supports multiple AR/VR platforms, you can look through the available interface, and either present the user with a selection or simply try to initialize each interface and use the first one that returns `true`.

> method get_interfaces() -> Array[Dictionary] ; qualifiers=const

Returns a list of available interfaces the ID and name of each interface.

> method get_reference_frame() -> Transform3D ; qualifiers=const

Returns the reference frame transform. Mostly used internally and exposed for GDExtension build interfaces.

> method get_tracker(tracker_name: StringName) -> XRTracker ; qualifiers=const

Returns the positional tracker with the given `tracker_name`.

> method get_trackers(tracker_types: int) -> Dictionary

Returns a dictionary of trackers for `tracker_types`.

> method remove_interface(interface: XRInterface) -> void

Removes this `interface`.

> method remove_tracker(tracker: XRTracker) -> void

Removes this `tracker`.

## Signals

> signal interface_added(interface_name: StringName)

Emitted when a new interface has been added.

> signal interface_removed(interface_name: StringName)

Emitted when an interface is removed.

> signal reference_frame_changed()

Emitted when the reference frame transform changes.

> signal tracker_added(tracker_name: StringName, type: int)

Emitted when a new tracker has been added. If you don't use a fixed number of controllers or if you're using `XRAnchor3D`s for an AR solution, it is important to react to this signal to add the appropriate `XRController3D` or `XRAnchor3D` nodes related to this new tracker.

> signal tracker_removed(tracker_name: StringName, type: int)

Emitted when a tracker is removed. You should remove any `XRController3D` or `XRAnchor3D` points if applicable. This is not mandatory, the nodes simply become inactive and will be made active again when a new tracker becomes available (i.e. a new controller is switched on that takes the place of the previous one).

> signal tracker_updated(tracker_name: StringName, type: int)

Emitted when an existing tracker has been updated. This can happen if the user switches controllers.

> signal world_origin_changed()

Emitted when the world origin transform changes.

## Enumerations

> enum RotationMode

> enum_value RotationMode.RESET_FULL_ROTATION = 0

Fully reset the orientation of the HMD. Regardless of what direction the user is looking to in the real world. The user will look dead ahead in the virtual world.

> enum_value RotationMode.RESET_BUT_KEEP_TILT = 1

Resets the orientation but keeps the tilt of the device. So if we're looking down, we keep looking down but heading will be reset.

> enum_value RotationMode.DONT_RESET_ROTATION = 2

Does not reset the orientation of the HMD, only the position of the player gets centered.

> enum TrackerType

> enum_value TrackerType.TRACKER_HEAD = 1

The tracker tracks the location of the player's head. This is usually a location centered between the player's eyes. Note that for handheld AR devices this can be the current location of the device.

> enum_value TrackerType.TRACKER_CONTROLLER = 2

The tracker tracks the location of a controller.

> enum_value TrackerType.TRACKER_BASESTATION = 4

The tracker tracks the location of a base station.

> enum_value TrackerType.TRACKER_ANCHOR = 8

The tracker tracks the location and size of an AR anchor.

> enum_value TrackerType.TRACKER_HAND = 16

The tracker tracks the location and joints of a hand.

> enum_value TrackerType.TRACKER_BODY = 32

The tracker tracks the location and joints of a body.

> enum_value TrackerType.TRACKER_FACE = 64

The tracker tracks the expressions of a face.

> enum_value TrackerType.TRACKER_ANY_KNOWN = 127

Used internally to filter trackers of any known type.

> enum_value TrackerType.TRACKER_UNKNOWN = 128

Used internally if we haven't set the tracker type yet.

> enum_value TrackerType.TRACKER_ANY = 255

Used internally to select all trackers.
