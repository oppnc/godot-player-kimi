# SkeletonModification2DLookAt

> class SkeletonModification2DLookAt ; experimental=This class may be changed or removed in future versions.
> inherits SkeletonModification2DLookAt SkeletonModification2D

## Brief

A modification that rotates a `Bone2D` node to look at a target.

## Description

This `SkeletonModification2D` rotates a bone to look a target. This is extremely helpful for moving character's head to look at the player, rotating a turret to look at a target, or any other case where you want to make a bone rotate towards something quickly and easily.

## Properties

> property bone2d_node : NodePath ; default=NodePath("") ; setter=set_bone2d_node ; getter=get_bone2d_node

The `Bone2D` node that the modification will operate on.

> property bone_index : int ; default=-1 ; setter=set_bone_index ; getter=get_bone_index

The index of the `Bone2D` node that the modification will operate on.

> property target_nodepath : NodePath ; default=NodePath("") ; setter=set_target_node ; getter=get_target_node

The NodePath to the node that is the target for the LookAt modification. This node is what the modification will rotate the `Bone2D` to.

## Methods

> method get_additional_rotation() -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the amount of additional rotation that is applied after the LookAt modification executes.

> method get_constraint_angle_invert() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns whether the constraints to this modification are inverted or not.

> method get_constraint_angle_max() -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the constraint's maximum allowed angle.

> method get_constraint_angle_min() -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the constraint's minimum allowed angle.

> method get_enable_constraint() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the LookAt modification is using constraints.

> method set_additional_rotation(rotation: float) -> void

Sets the amount of additional rotation that is to be applied after executing the modification. This allows for offsetting the results by the inputted rotation amount.

> method set_constraint_angle_invert(invert: bool) -> void

When `true`, the modification will use an inverted joint constraint.
An inverted joint constraint only constraints the `Bone2D` to the angles *outside of* the inputted minimum and maximum angles. For this reason, it is referred to as an inverted joint constraint, as it constraints the joint to the outside of the inputted values.

> method set_constraint_angle_max(angle_max: float) -> void

Sets the constraint's maximum allowed angle.

> method set_constraint_angle_min(angle_min: float) -> void

Sets the constraint's minimum allowed angle.

> method set_enable_constraint(enable_constraint: bool) -> void

Sets whether this modification will use constraints or not. When `true`, constraints will be applied when solving the LookAt modification.
