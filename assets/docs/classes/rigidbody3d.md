# RigidBody3D

> class RigidBody3D
> inherits RigidBody3D PhysicsBody3D

## Brief

A 3D physics body that is moved by a physics simulation.

## Description

`RigidBody3D` implements full 3D physics. It cannot be controlled directly, instead, you must apply forces to it (gravity, impulses, etc.), and the physics simulation will calculate the resulting movement, rotation, react to collisions, and affect other physics bodies in its path.
The body's behavior can be adjusted via `lock_rotation`, `freeze`, and `freeze_mode`. By changing various properties of the object, such as `mass`, you can control how the physics simulation acts on it.
A rigid body will always maintain its shape and size, even when forces are applied to it. It is useful for objects that can be interacted with in an environment, such as a tree that can be knocked over or a stack of crates that can be pushed around.
If you need to directly affect the body, prefer `_integrate_forces` as it allows you to directly access the physics state.
If you need to override the default physics behavior, you can write a custom force integration function. See `custom_integrator`.
**Note:** Changing the 3D transform or `linear_velocity` of a `RigidBody3D` very often may lead to some unpredictable behaviors. This also happens when a `RigidBody3D` is the descendant of a constantly moving node, like another `RigidBody3D`, as that will cause its global transform to be set whenever its ancestor moves.

## Properties

> property angular_damp : float ; default=0.0 ; setter=set_angular_damp ; getter=get_angular_damp

Damps the body's rotation. By default, the body will use the `ProjectSettings.physics/3d/default_angular_damp` project setting or any value override set by an `Area3D` the body is in. Depending on `angular_damp_mode`, you can set `angular_damp` to be added to or to replace the body's damping value.
See `ProjectSettings.physics/3d/default_angular_damp` for more details about damping.

> property angular_damp_mode : DampMode ; default=0 ; setter=set_angular_damp_mode ; getter=get_angular_damp_mode

Defines how `angular_damp` is applied.

> property angular_velocity : Vector3 ; default=Vector3(0, 0, 0) ; setter=set_angular_velocity ; getter=get_angular_velocity

The RigidBody3D's rotational velocity in *radians* per second.

> property can_sleep : bool ; default=true ; setter=set_can_sleep ; getter=is_able_to_sleep

If `true`, the body can enter sleep mode when there is no movement. See `sleeping`.

> property center_of_mass : Vector3 ; default=Vector3(0, 0, 0) ; setter=set_center_of_mass ; getter=get_center_of_mass

The body's custom center of mass, relative to the body's origin position, when `center_of_mass_mode` is set to `CENTER_OF_MASS_MODE_CUSTOM`. This is the balanced point of the body, where applied forces only cause linear acceleration. Applying forces outside of the center of mass causes angular acceleration.
When `center_of_mass_mode` is set to `CENTER_OF_MASS_MODE_AUTO` (default value), the center of mass is automatically determined, but this does not update the value of `center_of_mass`.

> property center_of_mass_mode : CenterOfMassMode ; default=0 ; setter=set_center_of_mass_mode ; getter=get_center_of_mass_mode

Defines the way the body's center of mass is set.

> property constant_force : Vector3 ; default=Vector3(0, 0, 0) ; setter=set_constant_force ; getter=get_constant_force

The body's total constant positional forces applied during each physics update.
See `add_constant_force` and `add_constant_central_force`.

> property constant_torque : Vector3 ; default=Vector3(0, 0, 0) ; setter=set_constant_torque ; getter=get_constant_torque

The body's total constant rotational forces applied during each physics update.
See `add_constant_torque`.

> property contact_monitor : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_contact_monitor ; getter=is_contact_monitor_enabled

If `true`, the RigidBody3D will emit signals when it collides with another body.
**Note:** By default the maximum contacts reported is set to 0, meaning nothing will be recorded, see `max_contacts_reported`.

> property continuous_cd : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_use_continuous_collision_detection ; getter=is_using_continuous_collision_detection

If `true`, continuous collision detection is used.
Continuous collision detection tries to predict where a moving body will collide, instead of moving it and correcting its movement if it collided. Continuous collision detection is more precise, and misses fewer impacts by small, fast-moving objects. Not using continuous collision detection is faster to compute, but can miss small, fast-moving objects.

> property custom_integrator : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_use_custom_integrator ; getter=is_using_custom_integrator

If `true`, the standard force integration (like gravity or damping) will be disabled for this body. Other than collision response, the body will only move as determined by the `_integrate_forces` method, if that virtual method is overridden.
Setting this property will call the method `PhysicsServer3D.body_set_omit_force_integration` internally.

> property freeze : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_freeze_enabled ; getter=is_freeze_enabled

If `true`, the body is frozen. Gravity and forces are not applied anymore.
See `freeze_mode` to set the body's behavior when frozen.
**Note:** For a body that is always frozen, use `StaticBody3D` or `AnimatableBody3D` instead.

> property freeze_mode : FreezeMode ; default=0 ; setter=set_freeze_mode ; getter=get_freeze_mode

The body's freeze mode. Determines the body's behavior when `freeze` is `true`.
**Note:** For a body that is always frozen, use `StaticBody3D` or `AnimatableBody3D` instead.

> property gravity_scale : float ; default=1.0 ; setter=set_gravity_scale ; getter=get_gravity_scale

This is multiplied by `ProjectSettings.physics/3d/default_gravity` to produce this body's gravity. For example, a value of `1.0` will apply normal gravity, `2.0` will apply double the gravity, and `0.5` will apply half the gravity to this body.

> property inertia : Vector3 ; default=Vector3(0, 0, 0) ; setter=set_inertia ; getter=get_inertia

The body's moment of inertia. This is like mass, but for rotation: it determines how much torque it takes to rotate the body on each axis. The moment of inertia is usually computed automatically from the mass and the shapes, but this property allows you to set a custom value.
If set to `Vector3.ZERO`, inertia is automatically computed (default value).
**Note:** This value does not change when inertia is automatically computed. Use `PhysicsServer3D` to get the computed inertia.

```gdscript
            @onready var ball = $Ball

            func get_ball_inertia():
                return PhysicsServer3D.body_get_direct_state(ball.get_rid()).inverse_inertia.inverse()

```

```csharp
            private RigidBody3D _ball;

            public override void _Ready()
            {
                _ball = GetNode<RigidBody3D>("Ball");
            }

            private Vector3 GetBallInertia()
            {
                return PhysicsServer3D.BodyGetDirectState(_ball.GetRid()).InverseInertia.Inverse();
            }

```

> property linear_damp : float ; default=0.0 ; setter=set_linear_damp ; getter=get_linear_damp

Damps the body's movement. By default, the body will use the `ProjectSettings.physics/3d/default_linear_damp` project setting or any value override set by an `Area3D` the body is in. Depending on `linear_damp_mode`, you can set `linear_damp` to be added to or to replace the body's damping value.
See `ProjectSettings.physics/3d/default_linear_damp` for more details about damping.

> property linear_damp_mode : DampMode ; default=0 ; setter=set_linear_damp_mode ; getter=get_linear_damp_mode

Defines how `linear_damp` is applied.

> property linear_velocity : Vector3 ; default=Vector3(0, 0, 0) ; setter=set_linear_velocity ; getter=get_linear_velocity

The body's linear velocity in units per second. Can be used sporadically, but **don't set this every frame**, because physics may run in another thread and runs at a different granularity. Use `_integrate_forces` as your process loop for precise control of the body state.

> property lock_rotation : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_lock_rotation_enabled ; getter=is_lock_rotation_enabled

If `true`, the body cannot rotate. Gravity and forces only apply linear movement.

> property mass : float ; default=1.0 ; setter=set_mass ; getter=get_mass

The body's mass.

> property max_contacts_reported : int ; default=0 ; setter=set_max_contacts_reported ; getter=get_max_contacts_reported

The maximum number of contacts that will be recorded. Requires a value greater than 0 and `contact_monitor` to be set to `true` to start to register contacts. Use `get_contact_count` to retrieve the count or `get_colliding_bodies` to retrieve bodies that have been collided with.
**Note:** The number of contacts is different from the number of collisions. Collisions between parallel edges will result in two contacts (one at each end), and collisions between parallel faces will result in four contacts (one at each corner).

> property physics_material_override : PhysicsMaterial ; setter=set_physics_material_override ; getter=get_physics_material_override

The physics material override for the body.
If a material is assigned to this property, it will be used instead of any other physics material, such as an inherited one.

> property sleeping : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_sleeping ; getter=is_sleeping

If `true`, the body will not move and will not calculate forces until woken up by another body through, for example, a collision, or by using the `apply_impulse` or `apply_force` methods.

## Methods

> method _integrate_forces(state: PhysicsDirectBodyState3D) -> void ; qualifiers=virtual

Called during physics processing, allowing you to read and safely modify the simulation state for the object. By default, it is called before the standard force integration, but the `custom_integrator` property allows you to disable the standard force integration and do fully custom force integration for a body.

> method add_constant_central_force(force: Vector3) -> void

Adds a constant directional force without affecting rotation that keeps being applied over time until cleared with `constant_force = Vector3(0, 0, 0)`.
This is equivalent to using `add_constant_force` at the body's center of mass.

> method add_constant_force(force: Vector3, position: Vector3 = Vector3(0, 0, 0)) -> void

Adds a constant positioned force to the body that keeps being applied over time until cleared with `constant_force = Vector3(0, 0, 0)`.
`position` is the offset from the body origin in global coordinates.

> method add_constant_torque(torque: Vector3) -> void

Adds a constant rotational force without affecting position that keeps being applied over time until cleared with `constant_torque = Vector3(0, 0, 0)`.

> method apply_central_force(force: Vector3) -> void

Applies a directional force without affecting rotation. A force is time dependent and meant to be applied every physics update.
This is equivalent to using `apply_force` at the body's center of mass.

> method apply_central_impulse(impulse: Vector3) -> void

Applies a directional impulse without affecting rotation.
An impulse is time-independent! Applying an impulse every frame would result in a framerate-dependent force. For this reason, it should only be used when simulating one-time impacts (use the "_force" functions otherwise).
This is equivalent to using `apply_impulse` at the body's center of mass.

> method apply_force(force: Vector3, position: Vector3 = Vector3(0, 0, 0)) -> void

Applies a positioned force to the body. A force is time dependent and meant to be applied every physics update.
`position` is the offset from the body origin in global coordinates.

> method apply_impulse(impulse: Vector3, position: Vector3 = Vector3(0, 0, 0)) -> void

Applies a positioned impulse to the body.
An impulse is time-independent! Applying an impulse every frame would result in a framerate-dependent force. For this reason, it should only be used when simulating one-time impacts (use the "_force" functions otherwise).
`position` is the offset from the body origin in global coordinates.

> method apply_torque(torque: Vector3) -> void

Applies a rotational force without affecting position. A force is time dependent and meant to be applied every physics update.
**Note:** `inertia` is required for this to work. To have `inertia`, an active `CollisionShape3D` must be a child of the node, or you can manually set `inertia`.

> method apply_torque_impulse(impulse: Vector3) -> void

Applies a rotational impulse to the body without affecting the position.
An impulse is time-independent! Applying an impulse every frame would result in a framerate-dependent force. For this reason, it should only be used when simulating one-time impacts (use the "_force" functions otherwise).
**Note:** `inertia` is required for this to work. To have `inertia`, an active `CollisionShape3D` must be a child of the node, or you can manually set `inertia`.

> method get_colliding_bodies() -> Array[Node3D] ; qualifiers=const

Returns a list of the bodies colliding with this one. Requires `contact_monitor` to be set to `true` and `max_contacts_reported` to be set high enough to detect all the collisions.
**Note:** The result of this test is not immediate after moving objects. For performance, list of collisions is updated once per frame and before the physics step. Consider using signals instead.

> method get_contact_count() -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the number of contacts this body has with other bodies. By default, this returns 0 unless bodies are configured to monitor contacts (see `contact_monitor`).
**Note:** To retrieve the colliding bodies, use `get_colliding_bodies`.

> method get_inverse_inertia_tensor() -> Basis ; qualifiers=const

Returns the inverse inertia tensor basis. This is used to calculate the angular acceleration resulting from a torque applied to the `RigidBody3D`.

> method set_axis_velocity(axis_velocity: Vector3) -> void

Sets an axis velocity. The velocity in the given vector axis will be set as the given vector length. This is useful for jumping behavior.

## Enumerations

> enum CenterOfMassMode

> enum_value CenterOfMassMode.CENTER_OF_MASS_MODE_AUTO = 0

In this mode, the body's center of mass is calculated automatically based on its shapes. This assumes that the shapes' origins are also their center of mass.

> enum_value CenterOfMassMode.CENTER_OF_MASS_MODE_CUSTOM = 1

In this mode, the body's center of mass is set through `center_of_mass`. Defaults to the body's origin position.

> enum DampMode

> enum_value DampMode.DAMP_MODE_COMBINE = 0

In this mode, the body's damping value is added to any value set in areas or the default value.

> enum_value DampMode.DAMP_MODE_REPLACE = 1

In this mode, the body's damping value replaces any value set in areas or the default value.

> enum FreezeMode

> enum_value FreezeMode.FREEZE_MODE_STATIC = 0

Static body freeze mode (default). The body is not affected by gravity and forces. It can be only moved by user code and doesn't collide with other bodies along its path.

> enum_value FreezeMode.FREEZE_MODE_KINEMATIC = 1

Kinematic body freeze mode. Similar to `FREEZE_MODE_STATIC`, but collides with other bodies along its path when moved. Useful for a frozen body that needs to be animated.
