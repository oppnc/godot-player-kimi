# StreamPeer

> class StreamPeer
> inherits StreamPeer RefCounted

## Brief

Abstract base class for interacting with streams.

## Description

StreamPeer is an abstract base class mostly used for stream-based protocols (such as TCP). It provides an API for sending and receiving data through streams as raw data or strings.
**Note:** When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the `INTERNET` permission in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one-click deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by Android.

## Properties

> property big_endian : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_big_endian ; getter=is_big_endian_enabled

If `true`, this `StreamPeer` will using big-endian format for encoding and decoding.

## Methods

> method get_8() -> int

Gets a signed byte from the stream.

> method get_16() -> int

Gets a signed 16-bit value from the stream.

> method get_32() -> int

Gets a signed 32-bit value from the stream.

> method get_64() -> int

Gets a signed 64-bit value from the stream.

> method get_available_bytes() -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the number of bytes this `StreamPeer` has available.

> method get_data(bytes: int) -> Array

Returns a chunk data with the received bytes, as an `Array` containing two elements: an `Error` constant and a `PackedByteArray`. `bytes` is the number of bytes to be received. If not enough bytes are available, the function will block until the desired amount is received.

> method get_double() -> float

Gets a double-precision float from the stream.

> method get_float() -> float

Gets a single-precision float from the stream.

> method get_half() -> float

Gets a half-precision float from the stream.

> method get_partial_data(bytes: int) -> Array

Returns a chunk data with the received bytes, as an `Array` containing two elements: an `Error` constant and a `PackedByteArray`. `bytes` is the number of bytes to be received. If not enough bytes are available, the function will return how many were actually received.

> method get_string(bytes: int = -1) -> String

Gets an ASCII string with byte-length `bytes` from the stream. If `bytes` is negative (default) the length will be read from the stream using the reverse process of `put_string`.

> method get_u8() -> int

Gets an unsigned byte from the stream.

> method get_u16() -> int

Gets an unsigned 16-bit value from the stream.

> method get_u32() -> int

Gets an unsigned 32-bit value from the stream.

> method get_u64() -> int

Gets an unsigned 64-bit value from the stream.

> method get_utf8_string(bytes: int = -1) -> String

Gets a UTF-8 string with byte-length `bytes` from the stream (this decodes the string sent as UTF-8). If `bytes` is negative (default) the length will be read from the stream using the reverse process of `put_utf8_string`.

> method get_var(allow_objects: bool = false) -> Variant

Gets a Variant from the stream. If `allow_objects` is `true`, decoding objects is allowed.
Internally, this uses the same decoding mechanism as the `@GlobalScope.bytes_to_var` method.
**Warning:** Deserialized objects can contain code which gets executed. Do not use this option if the serialized object comes from untrusted sources to avoid potential security threats such as remote code execution.

> method put_8(value: int) -> void

Puts a signed byte into the stream.

> method put_16(value: int) -> void

Puts a signed 16-bit value into the stream.

> method put_32(value: int) -> void

Puts a signed 32-bit value into the stream.

> method put_64(value: int) -> void

Puts a signed 64-bit value into the stream.

> method put_data(data: PackedByteArray) -> Error

Sends a chunk of data through the connection, blocking if necessary until the data is done sending. This function returns an `Error` code.

> method put_double(value: float) -> void

Puts a double-precision float into the stream.

> method put_float(value: float) -> void

Puts a single-precision float into the stream.

> method put_half(value: float) -> void

Puts a half-precision float into the stream.

> method put_partial_data(data: PackedByteArray) -> Array

Sends a chunk of data through the connection. If all the data could not be sent at once, only part of it will. This function returns two values, an `Error` code and an integer, describing how much data was actually sent.

> method put_string(value: String) -> void

Puts a zero-terminated ASCII string into the stream prepended by a 32-bit unsigned integer representing its size.
**Note:** To put an ASCII string without prepending its size, you can use `put_data`:

```gdscript
                put_data("Hello world".to_ascii_buffer())

```

```csharp
                PutData("Hello World".ToAsciiBuffer());

```

> method put_u8(value: int) -> void

Puts an unsigned byte into the stream.

> method put_u16(value: int) -> void

Puts an unsigned 16-bit value into the stream.

> method put_u32(value: int) -> void

Puts an unsigned 32-bit value into the stream.

> method put_u64(value: int) -> void

Puts an unsigned 64-bit value into the stream.

> method put_utf8_string(value: String) -> void

Puts a zero-terminated UTF-8 string into the stream prepended by a 32 bits unsigned integer representing its size.
**Note:** To put a UTF-8 string without prepending its size, you can use `put_data`:

```gdscript
                put_data("Hello world".to_utf8_buffer())

```

```csharp
                PutData("Hello World".ToUtf8Buffer());

```

> method put_var(value: Variant, full_objects: bool = false) -> void

Puts a Variant into the stream. If `full_objects` is `true` encoding objects is allowed (and can potentially include code).
Internally, this uses the same encoding mechanism as the `@GlobalScope.var_to_bytes` method.
