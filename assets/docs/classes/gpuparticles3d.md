## Brief

A 3D particle emitter.

## Description

3D particle node used to create a variety of particle systems and effects. `GPUParticles3D` features an emitter that generates some number of particles at a given rate.
Use `process_material` to add a `ParticleProcessMaterial` to configure particle appearance and behavior. Alternatively, you can add a `ShaderMaterial` which will be applied to all particles.

## Properties

> property amount : int ; default=8 ; setter=set_amount ; getter=get_amount

The number of particles to emit in one emission cycle. The effective emission rate is `(amount * amount_ratio) / lifetime` particles per second. Higher values will increase GPU requirements, even if not all particles are visible at a given time or if `amount_ratio` is decreased.
**Note:** Changing this value will cause the particle system to restart. To avoid this, change `amount_ratio` instead.

> property amount_ratio : float ; default=1.0 ; setter=set_amount_ratio ; getter=get_amount_ratio

The ratio of particles that should actually be emitted. If set to a value lower than `1.0`, this will set the amount of emitted particles throughout the lifetime to `amount * amount_ratio`. Unlike changing `amount`, changing `amount_ratio` while emitting does not affect already-emitted particles and doesn't cause the particle system to restart. `amount_ratio` can be used to create effects that make the number of emitted particles vary over time.
**Note:** Reducing the `amount_ratio` has no performance benefit, since resources need to be allocated and processed for the total `amount` of particles regardless of the `amount_ratio`. If you don't intend to change the number of particles emitted while the particles are emitting, make sure `amount_ratio` is set to `1` and change `amount` to your liking instead.

> property collision_base_size : float ; default=0.01 ; setter=set_collision_base_size ; getter=get_collision_base_size

The base diameter for particle collision in meters. If particles appear to sink into the ground when colliding, increase this value. If particles appear to float when colliding, decrease this value. Only effective if `ParticleProcessMaterial.collision_mode` is `ParticleProcessMaterial.COLLISION_RIGID` or `ParticleProcessMaterial.COLLISION_HIDE_ON_CONTACT`.
**Note:** Particles always have a spherical collision shape.

> property draw_order : DrawOrder ; default=0 ; setter=set_draw_order ; getter=get_draw_order

Particle draw order.
**Note:** `DRAW_ORDER_INDEX` is the only option that supports motion vectors for effects like TAA. It is suggested to use this draw order if the particles are opaque to fix ghosting artifacts.

> property draw_pass_1 : Mesh ; setter=set_draw_pass_mesh ; getter=get_draw_pass_mesh

`Mesh` that is drawn for the first draw pass.

> property draw_pass_2 : Mesh ; setter=set_draw_pass_mesh ; getter=get_draw_pass_mesh

`Mesh` that is drawn for the second draw pass.

> property draw_pass_3 : Mesh ; setter=set_draw_pass_mesh ; getter=get_draw_pass_mesh

`Mesh` that is drawn for the third draw pass.

> property draw_pass_4 : Mesh ; setter=set_draw_pass_mesh ; getter=get_draw_pass_mesh

`Mesh` that is drawn for the fourth draw pass.

> property draw_passes : int ; default=1 ; setter=set_draw_passes ; getter=get_draw_passes

The number of draw passes when rendering particles.

> property draw_skin : Skin ; setter=set_skin ; getter=get_skin

> property emitting : bool ; default=true ; setter=set_emitting ; getter=is_emitting

If `true`, particles are being emitted. `emitting` can be used to start and stop particles from emitting. However, if `one_shot` is `true` setting `emitting` to `true` will not restart the emission cycle unless all active particles have finished processing. Use the `finished` signal to be notified once all active particles finish processing.
**Note:** For `one_shot` emitters, due to the particles being computed on the GPU, there may be a short period after receiving the `finished` signal during which setting this to `true` will not restart the emission cycle.
**Tip:** If your `one_shot` emitter needs to immediately restart emitting particles once `finished` signal is received, consider calling `restart` instead of setting `emitting`.

> property explosiveness : float ; default=0.0 ; setter=set_explosiveness_ratio ; getter=get_explosiveness_ratio

Time ratio between each emission. If `0`, particles are emitted continuously. If `1`, all particles are emitted simultaneously.

> property fixed_fps : int ; default=30 ; setter=set_fixed_fps ; getter=get_fixed_fps

The particle system's frame rate is fixed to a value. For example, changing the value to 2 will make the particles render at 2 frames per second. Note this does not slow down the simulation of the particle system itself.

> property fract_delta : bool ; default=true ; setter=set_fractional_delta ; getter=get_fractional_delta

If `true`, results in fractional delta calculation which has a smoother particles display effect.

> property interp_to_end : float ; default=0.0 ; setter=set_interp_to_end ; getter=get_interp_to_end

Causes all the particles in this node to interpolate towards the end of their lifetime.
**Note:** This only works when used with a `ParticleProcessMaterial`. It needs to be manually implemented for custom process shaders.

> property interpolate : bool ; default=true ; setter=set_interpolate ; getter=get_interpolate

Enables particle interpolation, which makes the particle movement smoother when their `fixed_fps` is lower than the screen refresh rate.

> property lifetime : float ; default=1.0 ; setter=set_lifetime ; getter=get_lifetime

The amount of time each particle will exist (in seconds). The effective emission rate is `(amount * amount_ratio) / lifetime` particles per second.

> property local_coords : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_use_local_coordinates ; getter=get_use_local_coordinates

If `true`, particles use the parent node's coordinate space (known as local coordinates). This will cause particles to move and rotate along the `GPUParticles3D` node (and its parents) when it is moved or rotated. If `false`, particles use global coordinates; they will not move or rotate along the `GPUParticles3D` node (and its parents) when it is moved or rotated.

> property one_shot : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_one_shot ; getter=get_one_shot

If `true`, only the number of particles equal to `amount` will be emitted.

> property preprocess : float ; default=0.0 ; setter=set_pre_process_time ; getter=get_pre_process_time

Amount of time to preprocess the particles before animation starts. Lets you start the animation some time after particles have started emitting.
**Note:** This can be very expensive if set to a high number as it requires running the particle shader a number of times equal to the `fixed_fps` (or 30, if `fixed_fps` is 0) for every second. In extreme cases it can even lead to a GPU crash due to the volume of work done in a single frame.

> property process_material : Material ; setter=set_process_material ; getter=get_process_material

`Material` for processing particles. Can be a `ParticleProcessMaterial` or a `ShaderMaterial`.

> property randomness : float ; default=0.0 ; setter=set_randomness_ratio ; getter=get_randomness_ratio

Emission randomness ratio.

> property seed : int ; default=0 ; setter=set_seed ; getter=get_seed

Sets the random seed used by the particle system. Only effective if `use_fixed_seed` is `true`.

> property speed_scale : float ; default=1.0 ; setter=set_speed_scale ; getter=get_speed_scale

Speed scaling ratio. A value of `0` can be used to pause the particles.

> property sub_emitter : NodePath ; default=NodePath("") ; setter=set_sub_emitter ; getter=get_sub_emitter

Path to another `GPUParticles3D` node that will be used as a subemitter (see `ParticleProcessMaterial.sub_emitter_mode`). Subemitters can be used to achieve effects such as fireworks, sparks on collision, bubbles popping into water drops, and more.
**Note:** When `sub_emitter` is set, the target `GPUParticles3D` node will no longer emit particles on its own.

> property trail_enabled : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_trail_enabled ; getter=is_trail_enabled

If `true`, enables particle trails using a mesh skinning system. Designed to work with `RibbonTrailMesh` and `TubeTrailMesh`.
**Note:** `BaseMaterial3D.use_particle_trails` must also be enabled on the particle mesh's material. Otherwise, setting `trail_enabled` to `true` will have no effect.
**Note:** Unlike `GPUParticles2D`, the number of trail sections and subdivisions is set in the `RibbonTrailMesh` or the `TubeTrailMesh`'s properties.

> property trail_lifetime : float ; default=0.3 ; setter=set_trail_lifetime ; getter=get_trail_lifetime

The amount of time the particle's trail should represent (in seconds). Only effective if `trail_enabled` is `true`.

> property transform_align : TransformAlign ; default=0 ; setter=set_transform_align ; getter=get_transform_align

The alignment of particles. Use this for billboarding and aligning to velocity.

> property transform_align_axis : RenderingServer.ParticlesTransformAlignAxis ; setter=set_transform_align_axis ; getter=get_transform_align_axis

When using transform align local billboard, which axis to use for the billboarding. Supports only X or Y.

> property transform_align_channel_filter : RenderingServer.ParticlesTransformAlignCustomSrc ; setter=set_transform_align_channel_filter ; getter=get_transform_align_channel_filter

In the case of billboarded particles, which custom channel to read from to calculate their angle.

> property use_fixed_seed : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_use_fixed_seed ; getter=get_use_fixed_seed

If `true`, particles will use the same seed for every simulation using the seed defined in `seed`. This is useful for situations where the visual outcome should be consistent across replays, for example when using Movie Maker mode.

> property visibility_aabb : AABB ; default=AABB(-4, -4, -4, 8, 8, 8) ; setter=set_visibility_aabb ; getter=get_visibility_aabb

The `AABB` that determines the node's region which needs to be visible on screen for the particle system to be active. `GeometryInstance3D.extra_cull_margin` is added on each of the AABB's axes. Particle collisions and attraction will only occur within this area.
Grow the box if particles suddenly appear/disappear when the node enters/exits the screen. The `AABB` can be grown via code or with the **Particles → Generate AABB** editor tool.
**Note:** `visibility_aabb` is overridden by `GeometryInstance3D.custom_aabb` if that property is set to a non-default value.

## Methods

> method capture_aabb() -> AABB ; qualifiers=const

Returns the axis-aligned bounding box that contains all the particles that are active in the current frame.

> method convert_from_particles(particles: Node) -> void

Sets this node's properties to match a given `CPUParticles3D` node.

> method emit_particle(xform: Transform3D, velocity: Vector3, color: Color, custom: Color, flags: int) -> void

Emits a single particle. Whether `xform`, `velocity`, `color` and `custom` are applied depends on the value of `flags`. See `EmitFlags`.
The default ParticleProcessMaterial will overwrite `color` and use the contents of `custom` as `(rotation, age, animation, lifetime)`.
**Note:** `emit_particle` is only supported on the Forward+ and Mobile rendering methods, not Compatibility.

> method get_draw_pass_mesh(pass: int) -> Mesh ; qualifiers=const

Returns the `Mesh` that is drawn at index `pass`.

> method request_particles_process(process_time: float, process_time_residual: float = 0.0) -> void

Requests the particles to process for extra process time during a single frame.
`process_time` defines the time that the particles will process while emitting is on. `process_time_residual` defines the time that particles will process with emitting turned off for the simulation. When combined with `speed_scale` set to `0.0`, this is useful to be able to seek a particle system timeline.

> method restart(keep_seed: bool = false) -> void

Restarts the particle emission cycle, clearing existing particles. To avoid particles vanishing from the viewport, wait for the `finished` signal before calling.
**Note:** The `finished` signal is only emitted by `one_shot` emitters.
If `keep_seed` is `true`, the current random seed will be preserved. Useful for seeking and playback.

> method set_draw_pass_mesh(pass: int, mesh: Mesh) -> void

Sets the `Mesh` that is drawn at index `pass`.

## Signals

> signal finished()

Emitted when all active particles have finished processing. To immediately restart the emission cycle, call `restart`.
This signal is never emitted when `one_shot` is disabled, as particles will be emitted and processed continuously.
**Note:** For `one_shot` emitters, due to the particles being computed on the GPU, there may be a short period after receiving the signal during which setting `emitting` to `true` will not restart the emission cycle. This delay is avoided by instead calling `restart`.
