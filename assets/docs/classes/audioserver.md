# AudioServer

> class AudioServer
> inherits AudioServer Object

## Brief

Server interface for low-level audio access.

## Description

`AudioServer` is a low-level server interface for audio access. It is in charge of creating sample data (playable audio) as well as its playback via a voice interface.

## Properties

> property bus_count : int ; default=1 ; setter=set_bus_count ; getter=get_bus_count

Number of available audio buses.

> property input_device : String ; default="Default" ; setter=set_input_device ; getter=get_input_device

Name of the current device for audio input (see `get_input_device_list`). On systems with multiple audio inputs (such as analog, USB and HDMI audio), this can be used to select the audio input device. The value `"Default"` will record audio on the system-wide default audio input. If an invalid device name is set, the value will be reverted back to `"Default"`.
**Note:** `ProjectSettings.audio/driver/enable_input` must be `true` for audio input to work. See also that setting's description for caveats related to permissions and operating system privacy settings.

> property output_device : String ; default="Default" ; setter=set_output_device ; getter=get_output_device

Name of the current device for audio output (see `get_output_device_list`). On systems with multiple audio outputs (such as analog, USB and HDMI audio), this can be used to select the audio output device. The value `"Default"` will play audio on the system-wide default audio output. If an invalid device name is set, the value will be reverted back to `"Default"`.

> property playback_speed_scale : float ; default=1.0 ; setter=set_playback_speed_scale ; getter=get_playback_speed_scale

Scales the rate at which audio is played (i.e. setting it to `0.5` will make the audio be played at half its speed). See also `Engine.time_scale` to affect the general simulation speed, which is independent from `AudioServer.playback_speed_scale`.

## Methods

> method add_bus(at_position: int = -1) -> void

Adds a bus at `at_position`.

> method add_bus_effect(bus_idx: int, effect: AudioEffect, at_position: int = -1) -> void

Adds an `AudioEffect` effect to the bus `bus_idx` at `at_position`.

> method generate_bus_layout() -> AudioBusLayout ; qualifiers=const

Generates an `AudioBusLayout` using the available buses and effects.

> method get_bus_channels(bus_idx: int) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the number of channels of the bus at index `bus_idx`.

> method get_bus_effect(bus_idx: int, effect_idx: int) -> AudioEffect

Returns the `AudioEffect` at position `effect_idx` in bus `bus_idx`.

> method get_bus_effect_count(bus_idx: int) -> int

Returns the number of effects on the bus at `bus_idx`.

> method get_bus_effect_instance(bus_idx: int, effect_idx: int, channel: int = 0) -> AudioEffectInstance

Returns the `AudioEffectInstance` assigned to the given bus and effect indices (and optionally channel).

> method get_bus_index(bus_name: StringName) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the index of the bus with the name `bus_name`. Returns `-1` if no bus with the specified name exist.

> method get_bus_name(bus_idx: int) -> String ; qualifiers=const

Returns the name of the bus with the index `bus_idx`.

> method get_bus_peak_volume_left_db(bus_idx: int, channel: int) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the peak volume of the left speaker at bus index `bus_idx` and channel index `channel`.

> method get_bus_peak_volume_right_db(bus_idx: int, channel: int) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the peak volume of the right speaker at bus index `bus_idx` and channel index `channel`.

> method get_bus_send(bus_idx: int) -> StringName ; qualifiers=const

Returns the name of the bus that the bus at index `bus_idx` sends to.

> method get_bus_volume_db(bus_idx: int) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the volume of the bus at index `bus_idx` in dB.

> method get_bus_volume_linear(bus_idx: int) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the volume of the bus at index `bus_idx` as a linear value.
**Note:** The returned value is equivalent to the result of `@GlobalScope.db_to_linear` on the result of `get_bus_volume_db`.

> method get_driver_name() -> String ; qualifiers=const

Returns the name of the current audio driver. The default usually depends on the operating system, but may be overridden via the `--audio-driver` [command line argument]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/editor/command_line_tutorial.html). `--headless` also automatically sets the audio driver to `Dummy`. See also `ProjectSettings.audio/driver/driver`.

> method get_input_buffer_length_frames() -> int ; experimental=This method may be changed or removed in future versions.

Returns the absolute size of the microphone input buffer. This is set to a multiple of the audio latency and can be used to estimate the minimum rate at which the frames need to be fetched.

> method get_input_device_list() -> PackedStringArray

Returns the names of all audio input devices detected on the system.
**Note:** `ProjectSettings.audio/driver/enable_input` must be `true` for audio input to work. See also that setting's description for caveats related to permissions and operating system privacy settings.

> method get_input_frames(frames: int) -> PackedVector2Array ; experimental=This method may be changed or removed in future versions.

Returns a `PackedVector2Array` containing exactly `frames` audio samples from the internal microphone buffer if available, otherwise returns an empty `PackedVector2Array`.
The buffer is filled at the rate of `get_input_mix_rate` frames per second when `set_input_device_active` has successfully been set to `true`.
The samples are signed floating-point PCM values between `-1` and `1`.

> method get_input_frames_available() -> int ; experimental=This method may be changed or removed in future versions.

Returns the number of frames available to read using `get_input_frames`.

> method get_input_mix_rate() -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the sample rate at the input of the `AudioServer`.

> method get_mix_rate() -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the sample rate at the output of the `AudioServer`.

> method get_output_device_list() -> PackedStringArray

Returns the names of all audio output devices detected on the system.

> method get_output_latency() -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the audio driver's effective output latency. This is based on `ProjectSettings.audio/driver/output_latency`, but the exact returned value will differ depending on the operating system and audio driver.
**Note:** This can be expensive; it is not recommended to call `get_output_latency` every frame.

> method get_speaker_mode() -> SpeakerMode ; qualifiers=const

Returns the speaker configuration.

> method get_time_since_last_mix() -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the relative time since the last mix occurred, in seconds.

> method get_time_to_next_mix() -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the relative time until the next mix occurs, in seconds.

> method is_bus_bypassing_effects(bus_idx: int) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

If `true`, the bus at index `bus_idx` is bypassing effects.

> method is_bus_effect_enabled(bus_idx: int, effect_idx: int) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

If `true`, the effect at index `effect_idx` on the bus at index `bus_idx` is enabled.

> method is_bus_mute(bus_idx: int) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

If `true`, the bus at index `bus_idx` is muted.

> method is_bus_solo(bus_idx: int) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

If `true`, the bus at index `bus_idx` is in solo mode.

> method is_stream_registered_as_sample(stream: AudioStream) -> bool ; experimental=This method may be changed or removed in future versions.

If `true`, the stream is registered as a sample. The engine will not have to register it before playing the sample.
If `false`, the stream will have to be registered before playing it. To prevent lag spikes, register the stream as sample with `register_stream_as_sample`.

> method lock() -> void

Locks the audio driver's main loop.
**Note:** Remember to unlock it afterwards.

> method move_bus(index: int, to_index: int) -> void

Moves the bus from index `index` to index `to_index`.

> method register_stream_as_sample(stream: AudioStream) -> void ; experimental=This method may be changed or removed in future versions.

Forces the registration of a stream as a sample.
**Note:** Lag spikes may occur when calling this method, especially on single-threaded builds. It is suggested to call this method while loading assets, where the lag spike could be masked, instead of registering the sample right before it needs to be played.

> method remove_bus(index: int) -> void

Removes the bus at index `index`.

> method remove_bus_effect(bus_idx: int, effect_idx: int) -> void

Removes the effect at index `effect_idx` from the bus at index `bus_idx`.

> method set_bus_bypass_effects(bus_idx: int, enable: bool) -> void

If `true`, the bus at index `bus_idx` is bypassing effects.

> method set_bus_effect_enabled(bus_idx: int, effect_idx: int, enabled: bool) -> void

If `true`, the effect at index `effect_idx` on the bus at index `bus_idx` is enabled.

> method set_bus_layout(bus_layout: AudioBusLayout) -> void

Overwrites the currently used `AudioBusLayout`.

> method set_bus_mute(bus_idx: int, enable: bool) -> void

If `true`, the bus at index `bus_idx` is muted.

> method set_bus_name(bus_idx: int, name: String) -> void

Sets the name of the bus at index `bus_idx` to `name`.

> method set_bus_send(bus_idx: int, send: StringName) -> void

Connects the output of the bus at `bus_idx` to the bus named `send`.

> method set_bus_solo(bus_idx: int, enable: bool) -> void

If `true`, the bus at index `bus_idx` is in solo mode.

> method set_bus_volume_db(bus_idx: int, volume_db: float) -> void

Sets the volume in decibels of the bus at index `bus_idx` to `volume_db`.

> method set_bus_volume_linear(bus_idx: int, volume_linear: float) -> void

Sets the volume as a linear value of the bus at index `bus_idx` to `volume_linear`.
**Note:** Using this method is equivalent to calling `set_bus_volume_db` with the result of `@GlobalScope.linear_to_db` on a value.

> method set_enable_tagging_used_audio_streams(enable: bool) -> void

If set to `true`, all instances of `AudioStreamPlayback` will call `AudioStreamPlayback._tag_used_streams` every mix step.
**Note:** This is enabled by default in the editor, as it is used by editor plugins for the audio stream previews.

> method set_input_device_active(active: bool) -> Error ; experimental=This method may be changed or removed in future versions.

If `active` is `true`, starts the microphone input stream specified by `input_device` or returns an error if it failed.
If `active` is `false`, stops the input stream if it is running.

> method swap_bus_effects(bus_idx: int, effect_idx: int, by_effect_idx: int) -> void

Swaps the position of two effects in bus `bus_idx`.

> method unlock() -> void

Unlocks the audio driver's main loop. (After locking it, you should always unlock it.)

## Signals

> signal bus_layout_changed()

Emitted when an audio bus is added, deleted, or moved.

> signal bus_renamed(bus_index: int, old_name: StringName, new_name: StringName)

Emitted when the audio bus at `bus_index` is renamed from `old_name` to `new_name`.

## Enumerations

> enum PlaybackType

> enum_value PlaybackType.PLAYBACK_TYPE_DEFAULT = 0 ; experimental=This constant may be changed or removed in future versions.

The playback will be considered of the type declared at `ProjectSettings.audio/general/default_playback_type`.

> enum_value PlaybackType.PLAYBACK_TYPE_STREAM = 1 ; experimental=This constant may be changed or removed in future versions.

Force the playback to be considered as a stream.

> enum_value PlaybackType.PLAYBACK_TYPE_SAMPLE = 2 ; experimental=This constant may be changed or removed in future versions.

Force the playback to be considered as a sample. This can provide lower latency and more stable playback (with less risk of audio crackling), at the cost of having less flexibility.
**Note:** Only currently supported on the web platform.
**Note:** `AudioEffect`s are not supported when playback is considered as a sample.

> enum_value PlaybackType.PLAYBACK_TYPE_MAX = 3 ; experimental=This constant may be changed or removed in future versions.

Represents the size of the `PlaybackType` enum.

> enum SpeakerMode

> enum_value SpeakerMode.SPEAKER_MODE_STEREO = 0

Two or fewer speakers were detected.

> enum_value SpeakerMode.SPEAKER_SURROUND_31 = 1

A 3.1 channel surround setup was detected.

> enum_value SpeakerMode.SPEAKER_SURROUND_51 = 2

A 5.1 channel surround setup was detected.

> enum_value SpeakerMode.SPEAKER_SURROUND_71 = 3

A 7.1 channel surround setup was detected.
