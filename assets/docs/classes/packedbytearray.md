# PackedByteArray

> class PackedByteArray

## Brief

A packed array of bytes.

## Description

An array specifically designed to hold bytes. Packs data tightly, so it saves memory for large array sizes.
`PackedByteArray` also provides methods to encode/decode various types to/from bytes. The way values are encoded is an implementation detail and shouldn't be relied upon when interacting with external apps.
**Note:** Packed arrays are always passed by reference. To get a copy of an array that can be modified independently of the original array, use `duplicate`. This is *not* the case for built-in properties and methods. In these cases the returned packed array is a copy, and changing it will *not* affect the original value. To update a built-in property of this type, modify the returned array and then assign it to the property again.
**Note:** In a boolean context, a packed array will evaluate to `false` if it's empty. Otherwise, a packed array will always evaluate to `true`.

## Constructors

> constructor PackedByteArray()

Constructs an empty `PackedByteArray`.

> constructor PackedByteArray(from: PackedByteArray)

Constructs a `PackedByteArray` as a copy of the given `PackedByteArray`.

> constructor PackedByteArray(from: Array)

Constructs a new `PackedByteArray`. Optionally, you can pass in a generic `Array` that will be converted.

## Methods

> method append(value: int) -> bool

Appends an element at the end of the array (alias of `push_back`).

> method append_array(array: PackedByteArray) -> void

Appends a `PackedByteArray` at the end of this array.

> method bsearch(value: int, before: bool = true) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Finds the index of an existing value (or the insertion index that maintains sorting order, if the value is not yet present in the array) using binary search. Optionally, a `before` specifier can be passed. If `false`, the returned index comes after all existing entries of the value in the array.
**Note:** Calling `bsearch` on an unsorted array results in unexpected behavior.

> method bswap16(offset: int = 0, count: int = -1) -> void

Swaps the byte order of `count` 16-bit segments of the array starting at `offset`. Swap is done in-place. If `count` is less than zero, all segments to the end of array are processed, if processed data size is not a multiple of 2, the byte after the last processed 16-bit segment is not modified.

> method bswap32(offset: int = 0, count: int = -1) -> void

Swaps the byte order of `count` 32-bit segments of the array starting at `offset`. Swap is done in-place. If `count` is less than zero, all segments to the end of array are processed, if processed data size is not a multiple of 4, bytes after the last processed 32-bit segment are not modified.

> method bswap64(offset: int = 0, count: int = -1) -> void

Swaps the byte order of `count` 64-bit segments of the array starting at `offset`. Swap is done in-place. If `count` is less than zero, all segments to the end of array are processed, if processed data size is not a multiple of 8, bytes after the last processed 64-bit segment are not modified.

> method clear() -> void

Clears the array. This is equivalent to using `resize` with a size of `0`.

> method compress(compression_mode: int = 0) -> PackedByteArray ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new `PackedByteArray` with the data compressed. Set the compression mode using one of `FileAccess.CompressionMode`'s constants.

> method count(value: int) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the number of times an element is in the array.

> method decode_double(byte_offset: int) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Decodes a 64-bit floating-point number from the bytes starting at `byte_offset`. Fails if the byte count is insufficient. Returns `0.0` if a valid number can't be decoded.

> method decode_float(byte_offset: int) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Decodes a 32-bit floating-point number from the bytes starting at `byte_offset`. Fails if the byte count is insufficient. Returns `0.0` if a valid number can't be decoded.

> method decode_half(byte_offset: int) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Decodes a 16-bit floating-point number from the bytes starting at `byte_offset`. Fails if the byte count is insufficient. Returns `0.0` if a valid number can't be decoded.

> method decode_s8(byte_offset: int) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Decodes a 8-bit signed integer number from the bytes starting at `byte_offset`. Fails if the byte count is insufficient. Returns `0` if a valid number can't be decoded.

> method decode_s16(byte_offset: int) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Decodes a 16-bit signed integer number from the bytes starting at `byte_offset`. Fails if the byte count is insufficient. Returns `0` if a valid number can't be decoded.

> method decode_s32(byte_offset: int) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Decodes a 32-bit signed integer number from the bytes starting at `byte_offset`. Fails if the byte count is insufficient. Returns `0` if a valid number can't be decoded.

> method decode_s64(byte_offset: int) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Decodes a 64-bit signed integer number from the bytes starting at `byte_offset`. Fails if the byte count is insufficient. Returns `0` if a valid number can't be decoded.

> method decode_u8(byte_offset: int) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Decodes a 8-bit unsigned integer number from the bytes starting at `byte_offset`. Fails if the byte count is insufficient. Returns `0` if a valid number can't be decoded.

> method decode_u16(byte_offset: int) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Decodes a 16-bit unsigned integer number from the bytes starting at `byte_offset`. Fails if the byte count is insufficient. Returns `0` if a valid number can't be decoded.

> method decode_u32(byte_offset: int) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Decodes a 32-bit unsigned integer number from the bytes starting at `byte_offset`. Fails if the byte count is insufficient. Returns `0` if a valid number can't be decoded.

> method decode_u64(byte_offset: int) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Decodes a 64-bit unsigned integer number from the bytes starting at `byte_offset`. Fails if the byte count is insufficient. Returns `0` if a valid number can't be decoded.

> method decode_var(byte_offset: int, allow_objects: bool = false) -> Variant ; qualifiers=const

Decodes a `Variant` from the bytes starting at `byte_offset`. Returns `null` if a valid variant can't be decoded or the value is `Object`-derived and `allow_objects` is `false`.

> method decode_var_size(byte_offset: int, allow_objects: bool = false) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Decodes a size of a `Variant` from the bytes starting at `byte_offset`. Requires at least 4 bytes of data starting at the offset, otherwise fails.

> method decompress(buffer_size: int, compression_mode: int = 0) -> PackedByteArray ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new `PackedByteArray` with the data decompressed. Set `buffer_size` to the size of the uncompressed data. Set the compression mode using one of `FileAccess.CompressionMode`'s constants.
**Note:** Decompression is not guaranteed to work with data not compressed by Godot, for example if data compressed with the deflate compression mode lacks a checksum or header.

> method decompress_dynamic(max_output_size: int, compression_mode: int = 0) -> PackedByteArray ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new `PackedByteArray` with the data decompressed. Set the compression mode using one of `FileAccess.CompressionMode`'s constants. **This method only accepts brotli, gzip, and deflate compression modes.**
This method is potentially slower than `decompress`, as it may have to re-allocate its output buffer multiple times while decompressing, whereas `decompress` knows it's output buffer size from the beginning.
GZIP has a maximal compression ratio of 1032:1, meaning it's very possible for a small compressed payload to decompress to a potentially very large output. To guard against this, you may provide a maximum size this function is allowed to allocate in bytes via `max_output_size`. Passing -1 will allow for unbounded output. If any positive value is passed, and the decompression exceeds that amount in bytes, then an error will be returned.
**Note:** Decompression is not guaranteed to work with data not compressed by Godot, for example if data compressed with the deflate compression mode lacks a checksum or header.

> method duplicate() -> PackedByteArray ; qualifiers=const

Creates a copy of the array, and returns it.

> method encode_double(byte_offset: int, value: float) -> void

Encodes a 64-bit floating-point number as bytes at the index of `byte_offset` bytes. The array must have at least 8 bytes of allocated space, starting at the offset.

> method encode_float(byte_offset: int, value: float) -> void

Encodes a 32-bit floating-point number as bytes at the index of `byte_offset` bytes. The array must have at least 4 bytes of space, starting at the offset.

> method encode_half(byte_offset: int, value: float) -> void

Encodes a 16-bit floating-point number as bytes at the index of `byte_offset` bytes. The array must have at least 2 bytes of space, starting at the offset.

> method encode_s8(byte_offset: int, value: int) -> void

Encodes a 8-bit signed integer number (signed byte) at the index of `byte_offset` bytes. The array must have at least 1 byte of space, starting at the offset.

> method encode_s16(byte_offset: int, value: int) -> void

Encodes a 16-bit signed integer number as bytes at the index of `byte_offset` bytes. The array must have at least 2 bytes of space, starting at the offset.

> method encode_s32(byte_offset: int, value: int) -> void

Encodes a 32-bit signed integer number as bytes at the index of `byte_offset` bytes. The array must have at least 4 bytes of space, starting at the offset.

> method encode_s64(byte_offset: int, value: int) -> void

Encodes a 64-bit signed integer number as bytes at the index of `byte_offset` bytes. The array must have at least 8 bytes of space, starting at the offset.

> method encode_u8(byte_offset: int, value: int) -> void

Encodes a 8-bit unsigned integer number (byte) at the index of `byte_offset` bytes. The array must have at least 1 byte of space, starting at the offset.

> method encode_u16(byte_offset: int, value: int) -> void

Encodes a 16-bit unsigned integer number as bytes at the index of `byte_offset` bytes. The array must have at least 2 bytes of space, starting at the offset.

> method encode_u32(byte_offset: int, value: int) -> void

Encodes a 32-bit unsigned integer number as bytes at the index of `byte_offset` bytes. The array must have at least 4 bytes of space, starting at the offset.

> method encode_u64(byte_offset: int, value: int) -> void

Encodes a 64-bit unsigned integer number as bytes at the index of `byte_offset` bytes. The array must have at least 8 bytes of space, starting at the offset.

> method encode_var(byte_offset: int, value: Variant, allow_objects: bool = false) -> int

Encodes a `Variant` at the index of `byte_offset` bytes. A sufficient space must be allocated, depending on the encoded variant's size. If `allow_objects` is `false`, `Object`-derived values are not permitted and will instead be serialized as ID-only.

> method erase(value: int) -> bool

Removes the first occurrence of a value from the array and returns `true`. If the value does not exist in the array, nothing happens and `false` is returned. To remove an element by index, use `remove_at` instead.

> method fill(value: int) -> void

Assigns the given value to all elements in the array. This can typically be used together with `resize` to create an array with a given size and initialized elements.

> method find(value: int, from: int = 0) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Searches the array for a value and returns its index or `-1` if not found. Optionally, the initial search index can be passed.

> method get(index: int) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the byte at the given `index` in the array. If `index` is out-of-bounds or negative, this method fails and returns `0`.
This method is similar (but not identical) to the `[]` operator. Most notably, when this method fails, it doesn't pause project execution if run from the editor.

> method get_string_from_ascii() -> String ; qualifiers=const

Converts ASCII/Latin-1 encoded array to `String`. Fast alternative to `get_string_from_utf8` if the content is ASCII/Latin-1 only. Unlike the UTF-8 function this function maps every byte to a character in the array. Multibyte sequences will not be interpreted correctly. For parsing user input always use `get_string_from_utf8`. This is the inverse of `String.to_ascii_buffer`.

> method get_string_from_multibyte_char(encoding: String = "") -> String ; qualifiers=const

Converts system multibyte code page encoded array to `String`. If conversion fails, empty string is returned. This is the inverse of `String.to_multibyte_char_buffer`.
The values permitted for `encoding` are system dependent. If `encoding` is empty string, system default encoding is used.
- For Windows, see [Code Page Identifiers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/Intl/code-page-identifiers) .NET names.
- For macOS and Linux/BSD, see `libiconv` library documentation and `iconv --list` for a list of supported encodings.

> method get_string_from_utf8() -> String ; qualifiers=const

Converts UTF-8 encoded array to `String`. Slower than `get_string_from_ascii` but supports UTF-8 encoded data. Use this function if you are unsure about the source of the data. For user input this function should always be preferred. Returns empty string if source array is not valid UTF-8 string. This is the inverse of `String.to_utf8_buffer`.

> method get_string_from_utf16() -> String ; qualifiers=const

Converts UTF-16 encoded array to `String`. If the BOM is missing, little-endianness is assumed. Returns empty string if source array is not valid UTF-16 string. This is the inverse of `String.to_utf16_buffer`.

> method get_string_from_utf32() -> String ; qualifiers=const

Converts UTF-32 encoded array to `String`. Returns empty string if source array is not valid UTF-32 string. This is the inverse of `String.to_utf32_buffer`.

> method get_string_from_wchar() -> String ; qualifiers=const

Converts wide character (`wchar_t`, UTF-16 on Windows, UTF-32 on other platforms) encoded array to `String`. Returns empty string if source array is not valid wide string. This is the inverse of `String.to_wchar_buffer`.

> method has(value: int) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the array contains `value`.

> method has_encoded_var(byte_offset: int, allow_objects: bool = false) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if a valid `Variant` value can be decoded at the `byte_offset`. Returns `false` otherwise or when the value is `Object`-derived and `allow_objects` is `false`.

> method hex_encode() -> String ; qualifiers=const

Returns a hexadecimal representation of this array as a `String`.

```gdscript
                var array = PackedByteArray([11, 46, 255])
                print(array.hex_encode()) # Prints "0b2eff"

```

```csharp
                byte[] array = [11, 46, 255];
                GD.Print(array.HexEncode()); // Prints "0b2eff"

```

> method insert(at_index: int, value: int) -> int

Inserts a new element at a given position in the array. The position must be valid, or at the end of the array (`idx == size()`).

> method is_empty() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the array is empty.

> method push_back(value: int) -> bool

Appends an element at the end of the array.

> method remove_at(index: int) -> void

Removes an element from the array by index.

> method resize(new_size: int) -> int

Sets the size of the array. If the array is grown, reserves elements at the end of the array. If the array is shrunk, truncates the array to the new size. Calling `resize` once and assigning the new values is faster than adding new elements one by one.
Returns `OK` on success, or one of the following `Error` constants if this method fails: `ERR_INVALID_PARAMETER` if the size is negative, or `ERR_OUT_OF_MEMORY` if allocations fail. Use `size` to find the actual size of the array after resize.

> method reverse() -> void

Reverses the order of the elements in the array.

> method rfind(value: int, from: int = -1) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Searches the array in reverse order. Optionally, a start search index can be passed. If negative, the start index is considered relative to the end of the array.

> method set(index: int, value: int) -> void

Changes the byte at the given index.

> method size() -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the number of elements in the array.

> method slice(begin: int, end: int = 2147483647) -> PackedByteArray ; qualifiers=const

Returns the slice of the `PackedByteArray`, from `begin` (inclusive) to `end` (exclusive), as a new `PackedByteArray`.
The absolute value of `begin` and `end` will be clamped to the array size, so the default value for `end` makes it slice to the size of the array by default (i.e. `arr.slice(1)` is a shorthand for `arr.slice(1, arr.size())`).
If either `begin` or `end` are negative, they will be relative to the end of the array (i.e. `arr.slice(0, -2)` is a shorthand for `arr.slice(0, arr.size() - 2)`).

> method sort() -> void

Sorts the elements of the array in ascending order.

> method to_color_array() -> PackedColorArray ; qualifiers=const

Returns a copy of the data converted to a `PackedColorArray`, where each block of 16 bytes has been converted to a `Color` variant.
**Note:** The size of the input array must be a multiple of 16 (size of four 32-bit float variables). The size of the new array will be `byte_array.size() / 16`. If the original data can't be converted to `Color` variants, the resulting data is undefined.

> method to_float32_array() -> PackedFloat32Array ; qualifiers=const

Returns a copy of the data converted to a `PackedFloat32Array`, where each block of 4 bytes has been converted to a 32-bit float (C++ `float`).
The size of the input array must be a multiple of 4 (size of 32-bit float). The size of the new array will be `byte_array.size() / 4`.
If the original data can't be converted to 32-bit floats, the resulting data is undefined.

> method to_float64_array() -> PackedFloat64Array ; qualifiers=const

Returns a copy of the data converted to a `PackedFloat64Array`, where each block of 8 bytes has been converted to a 64-bit float (C++ `double`, Godot `float`).
The size of the input array must be a multiple of 8 (size of 64-bit double). The size of the new array will be `byte_array.size() / 8`.
If the original data can't be converted to 64-bit floats, the resulting data is undefined.

> method to_int32_array() -> PackedInt32Array ; qualifiers=const

Returns a copy of the data converted to a `PackedInt32Array`, where each block of 4 bytes has been converted to a signed 32-bit integer (C++ `int32_t`).
The size of the input array must be a multiple of 4 (size of 32-bit integer). The size of the new array will be `byte_array.size() / 4`.
If the original data can't be converted to signed 32-bit integers, the resulting data is undefined.

> method to_int64_array() -> PackedInt64Array ; qualifiers=const

Returns a copy of the data converted to a `PackedInt64Array`, where each block of 8 bytes has been converted to a signed 64-bit integer (C++ `int64_t`, Godot `int`).
The size of the input array must be a multiple of 8 (size of 64-bit integer). The size of the new array will be `byte_array.size() / 8`.
If the original data can't be converted to signed 64-bit integers, the resulting data is undefined.

> method to_vector2_array() -> PackedVector2Array ; qualifiers=const

Returns a copy of the data converted to a `PackedVector2Array`, where each block of 8 bytes or 16 bytes (32-bit or 64-bit) has been converted to a `Vector2` variant.
**Note:** The size of the input array must be a multiple of 8 or 16 (depending on the build settings, see `Vector2` for more details). The size of the new array will be `byte_array.size() / (8 or 16)`. If the original data can't be converted to `Vector2` variants, the resulting data is undefined.

> method to_vector3_array() -> PackedVector3Array ; qualifiers=const

Returns a copy of the data converted to a `PackedVector3Array`, where each block of 12 or 24 bytes (32-bit or 64-bit) has been converted to a `Vector3` variant.
**Note:** The size of the input array must be a multiple of 12 or 24 (depending on the build settings, see `Vector3` for more details). The size of the new array will be `byte_array.size() / (12 or 24)`. If the original data can't be converted to `Vector3` variants, the resulting data is undefined.

> method to_vector4_array() -> PackedVector4Array ; qualifiers=const

Returns a copy of the data converted to a `PackedVector4Array`, where each block of 16 or 32 bytes (32-bit or 64-bit) has been converted to a `Vector4` variant.
**Note:** The size of the input array must be a multiple of 16 or 32 (depending on the build settings, see `Vector4` for more details). The size of the new array will be `byte_array.size() / (16 or 32)`. If the original data can't be converted to `Vector4` variants, the resulting data is undefined.

## Operators

> operator !=(right: PackedByteArray) -> bool

Returns `true` if contents of the arrays differ.

> operator +(right: PackedByteArray) -> PackedByteArray

Returns a new `PackedByteArray` with contents of `right` added at the end of this array. For better performance, consider using `append_array` instead.

> operator ==(right: PackedByteArray) -> bool

Returns `true` if contents of both arrays are the same, i.e. they have all equal bytes at the corresponding indices.

> operator [](index: int) -> int

Returns the byte at index `index`. Negative indices can be used to access the elements starting from the end. Using index out of array's bounds will result in an error.
Note that the byte is returned as a 64-bit `int`.
