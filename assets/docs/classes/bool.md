# bool

> class bool

## Brief

A built-in boolean type.

## Description

The `bool` is a built-in `Variant` type that may only store one of two values: `true` or `false`. You can imagine it as a switch that can be either turned on or off, or as a binary digit that can either be 1 or 0.
Booleans can be directly used in `if`, and other conditional statements:

```gdscript
        var can_shoot = true
        if can_shoot:
            launch_bullet()

```

```csharp
        bool canShoot = true;
        if (canShoot)
        {
            LaunchBullet();
        }

```

All comparison operators return booleans (`==`, `>`, `<=`, etc.). As such, it is not necessary to compare booleans themselves. You do not need to add `== true` or `== false`.
Booleans can be combined with the logical operators `and`, `or`, `not` to create complex conditions:

```gdscript
        if bullets > 0 and not is_reloading():
            launch_bullet()

        if bullets == 0 or is_reloading():
            play_clack_sound()

```

```csharp
        if (bullets > 0 && !IsReloading())
        {
            LaunchBullet();
        }

        if (bullets == 0 || IsReloading())
        {
            PlayClackSound();
        }

```

**Note:** In modern programming languages, logical operators are evaluated in order. All remaining conditions are skipped if their result would have no effect on the final value. This concept is known as [short-circuit evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation) and can be useful to avoid evaluating expensive conditions in some performance-critical cases.
**Note:** By convention, built-in methods and properties that return booleans are usually defined as yes-no questions, single adjectives, or similar (`String.is_empty`, `Node.can_process`, `Camera2D.enabled`, etc.).

## Constructors

> constructor bool()

Constructs a `bool` set to `false`.

> constructor bool(from: bool)

Constructs a `bool` as a copy of the given `bool`.

> constructor bool(from: float)

Casts a `float` value to a `bool`. Returns `false` if `from` is equal to `0.0` (including `-0.0`), and `true` for all other values (including `@GDScript.INF` and `@GDScript.NAN`).

> constructor bool(from: int)

Casts an `int` value to a `bool`. Returns `false` if `from` is equal to `0`, and `true` for all other values.

## Operators

> operator !=(right: bool) -> bool

Returns `true` if one `bool` is `true` and the other `bool` is `false`. Equivalent to logical XOR (NEQ).

> operator <(right: bool) -> bool

Returns `true` if the left `bool` is `false` and `right` is `true`.

> operator ==(right: bool) -> bool

Returns `true` if both `bool`s are `true`, or if both `bool`s are `false`. Equivalent to logical XNOR (EQ).

> operator >(right: bool) -> bool

Returns `true` if the left `bool` is `true` and `right` is `false`.
