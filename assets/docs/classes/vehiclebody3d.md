# VehicleBody3D

> class VehicleBody3D
> inherits VehicleBody3D RigidBody3D

## Brief

A 3D physics body that simulates the behavior of a car.

## Description

This physics body implements all the physics logic needed to simulate a car. It is based on the raycast vehicle system commonly found in physics engines. Aside from a `CollisionShape3D` for the main body of the vehicle, you must also add a `VehicleWheel3D` node for each wheel. You should also add a `MeshInstance3D` to this node for the 3D model of the vehicle, but this model should generally not include meshes for the wheels. You can control the vehicle by using the `brake`, `engine_force`, and `steering` properties. The position or orientation of this node shouldn't be changed directly.
**Note:** The local forward for this node is `Vector3.MODEL_FRONT`.
**Note:** The origin point of your VehicleBody3D will determine the center of gravity of your vehicle. To make the vehicle more grounded, the origin point is usually kept low, moving the `CollisionShape3D` and `MeshInstance3D` upwards.
**Note:** This class has known issues and isn't designed to provide realistic 3D vehicle physics. If you want advanced vehicle physics, you may have to write your own physics integration using `CharacterBody3D` or `RigidBody3D`.

## Properties

> property brake : float ; default=0.0 ; setter=set_brake ; getter=get_brake

Slows down the vehicle by applying a braking force. The vehicle is only slowed down if the wheels are in contact with a surface. The force you need to apply to adequately slow down your vehicle depends on the `RigidBody3D.mass` of the vehicle. For a vehicle with a mass set to 1000, try a value in the 25 - 30 range for hard braking.

> property engine_force : float ; default=0.0 ; setter=set_engine_force ; getter=get_engine_force

Accelerates the vehicle by applying an engine force. The vehicle is only sped up if the wheels that have `VehicleWheel3D.use_as_traction` set to `true` and are in contact with a surface. The `RigidBody3D.mass` of the vehicle has an effect on the acceleration of the vehicle. For a vehicle with a mass set to 1000, try a value in the 25 - 50 range for acceleration.
**Note:** The simulation does not take the effect of gears into account, you will need to add logic for this if you wish to simulate gears.
A negative value will result in the vehicle reversing.

> property mass : float ; default=40.0 ; setter=set_mass ; getter=get_mass ; overrides=RigidBody3D

> property steering : float ; default=0.0 ; setter=set_steering ; getter=get_steering

The steering angle for the vehicle. Setting this to a non-zero value will result in the vehicle turning when it's moving. Wheels that have `VehicleWheel3D.use_as_steering` set to `true` will automatically be rotated.
**Note:** This property is edited in the inspector in degrees. In code the property is set in radians.
