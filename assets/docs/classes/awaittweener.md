# AwaitTweener

> class AwaitTweener
> inherits AwaitTweener Tweener

## Brief

Awaits a specified signal.

## Description

`AwaitTweener` is used to await a specified signal, allowing asynchronous steps in `Tween` animation. See `Tween.tween_await` for more usage information.
The `Tweener.finished` signal is emitted when either the awaited signal is received, when timeout is reached, or when the target object is freed.

## Methods

> method set_timeout(timeout: float) -> AwaitTweener

Sets the maximum time an `AwaitTweener` can wait for the signal. Can be used as a safeguard for signals that may never be emitted. If not specified, the tweener will wait indefinitely.
