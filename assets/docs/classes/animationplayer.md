# AnimationPlayer

> class AnimationPlayer
> inherits AnimationPlayer AnimationMixer

## Brief

A node used for animation playback.

## Description

An animation player is used for general-purpose playback of animations. It contains a dictionary of `AnimationLibrary` resources and custom blend times between animation transitions.
Some methods and properties use a single key to reference an animation directly. These keys are formatted as the key for the library, followed by a forward slash, then the key for the animation within the library, for example `"movement/run"`. If the library's key is an empty string (known as the default library), the forward slash is omitted, being the same key used by the library.
`AnimationPlayer` is better-suited than `Tween` for more complex animations, for example ones with non-trivial timings. It can also be used over `Tween` if the animation track editor is more convenient than doing it in code.
Updating the target properties of animations occurs at the process frame.

## Properties

> property assigned_animation : StringName ; setter=set_assigned_animation ; getter=get_assigned_animation

If playing, the current animation's key, otherwise, the animation last played. When set, this changes the animation, but will not play it unless already playing. See also `current_animation`.

> property autoplay : StringName ; default=&"" ; setter=set_autoplay ; getter=get_autoplay

The key of the animation to play when the scene loads.

> property current_animation : StringName ; default=&"" ; setter=set_current_animation ; getter=get_current_animation

The key of the currently playing animation. If no animation is playing, the property's value is an empty string. Changing this value does not restart the animation. See `play` for more information on playing animations.
**Note:** While this property appears in the Inspector, it's not meant to be edited, and it's not saved in the scene. This property is mainly used to get the currently playing animation, and internally for animation playback tracks. For more information, see `Animation`.

> property current_animation_length : float ; getter=get_current_animation_length

The length (in seconds) of the currently playing animation.

> property current_animation_position : float ; getter=get_current_animation_position

The position (in seconds) of the currently playing animation.

> property movie_quit_on_finish : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_movie_quit_on_finish_enabled ; getter=is_movie_quit_on_finish_enabled

If `true` and the engine is running in Movie Maker mode (see `MovieWriter`), exits the engine with `SceneTree.quit` as soon as an animation is done playing in this `AnimationPlayer`. A message is printed when the engine quits for this reason.
**Note:** This obeys the same logic as the `AnimationMixer.animation_finished` signal, so it will not quit the engine if the animation is set to be looping.

> property playback_auto_capture : bool ; default=true ; setter=set_auto_capture ; getter=is_auto_capture

If `true`, performs `AnimationMixer.capture` before playback automatically. This means just `play_with_capture` is executed with default arguments instead of `play`.
**Note:** Capture interpolation is only performed if the animation contains a capture track. See also `Animation.UPDATE_CAPTURE`.

> property playback_auto_capture_duration : float ; default=-1.0 ; setter=set_auto_capture_duration ; getter=get_auto_capture_duration

See also `play_with_capture` and `AnimationMixer.capture`.
If `playback_auto_capture_duration` is negative value, the duration is set to the interval between the current position and the first key.

> property playback_auto_capture_ease_type : Tween.EaseType ; default=0 ; setter=set_auto_capture_ease_type ; getter=get_auto_capture_ease_type

The ease type of the capture interpolation. See also `Tween.EaseType`.

> property playback_auto_capture_transition_type : Tween.TransitionType ; default=0 ; setter=set_auto_capture_transition_type ; getter=get_auto_capture_transition_type

The transition type of the capture interpolation. See also `Tween.TransitionType`.

> property playback_default_blend_time : float ; default=0.0 ; setter=set_default_blend_time ; getter=get_default_blend_time

The default time in which to blend animations. Ranges from 0 to 4096 with 0.01 precision.

> property speed_scale : float ; default=1.0 ; setter=set_speed_scale ; getter=get_speed_scale

The speed scaling ratio. For example, if this value is `1`, then the animation plays at normal speed. If it's `0.5`, then it plays at half speed. If it's `2`, then it plays at double speed.
If set to a negative value, the animation is played in reverse. If set to `0`, the animation will not advance.

## Methods

> method animation_get_next(animation_from: StringName) -> StringName ; qualifiers=const

Returns the key of the animation which is queued to play after the `animation_from` animation.

> method animation_set_next(animation_from: StringName, animation_to: StringName) -> void

Triggers the `animation_to` animation when the `animation_from` animation completes.

> method clear_queue() -> void

Clears all queued, unplayed animations.

> method get_blend_time(animation_from: StringName, animation_to: StringName) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the blend time (in seconds) between two animations, referenced by their keys.

> method get_method_call_mode() -> AnimationMethodCallMode ; qualifiers=const ; deprecated=Use `AnimationMixer.callback_mode_method` instead.

Returns the call mode used for "Call Method" tracks.

> method get_playing_speed() -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the actual playing speed of current animation or `0` if not playing. This speed is the `speed_scale` property multiplied by `custom_speed` argument specified when calling the `play` method.
Returns a negative value if the current animation is playing backwards.

> method get_process_callback() -> AnimationProcessCallback ; qualifiers=const ; deprecated=Use `AnimationMixer.callback_mode_process` instead.

Returns the process notification in which to update animations.

> method get_queue() -> Array[StringName]

Returns a list of the animation keys that are currently queued to play.

> method get_root() -> NodePath ; qualifiers=const ; deprecated=Use `AnimationMixer.root_node` instead.

Returns the node which node path references will travel from.

> method get_section_end_time() -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the end time of the section currently being played.

> method get_section_start_time() -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the start time of the section currently being played.

> method has_section() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if an animation is currently playing with a section.

> method is_animation_active() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the an animation is currently active. An animation is active if it was played by calling `play` and was not finished yet, or was stopped by calling `stop`.
This can be used to check whether an animation is currently paused or stopped.

```text
                var is_paused = not is_playing() and is_animation_active()
                var is_stopped = not is_playing() and not is_animation_active()

```

> method is_playing() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if an animation is currently playing (even if `speed_scale` and/or `custom_speed` are `0`).

> method pause() -> void

Pauses the currently playing animation. The `current_animation_position` will be kept and calling `play` or `play_backwards` without arguments or with the same animation name as `assigned_animation` will resume the animation.
See also `stop`.

> method play(name: StringName = &"", custom_blend: float = -1, custom_speed: float = 1.0, from_end: bool = false) -> void

Plays the animation with key `name`. Custom blend times and speed can be set.
The `from_end` option only affects when switching to a new animation track, or if the same track but at the start or end. It does not affect resuming playback that was paused in the middle of an animation. If `custom_speed` is negative and `from_end` is `true`, the animation will play backwards (which is equivalent to calling `play_backwards`).
The `AnimationPlayer` keeps track of its current or last played animation with `assigned_animation`. If this method is called with that same animation `name`, or with no `name` parameter, the assigned animation will resume playing if it was paused.
**Note:** The animation will be updated the next time the `AnimationPlayer` is processed. If other variables are updated at the same time this is called, they may be updated too early. To perform the update immediately, call `advance(0)`.

> method play_backwards(name: StringName = &"", custom_blend: float = -1) -> void

Plays the animation with key `name` in reverse.
This method is a shorthand for `play` with `custom_speed = -1.0` and `from_end = true`, so see its description for more information.

> method play_section(name: StringName = &"", start_time: float = -1, end_time: float = -1, custom_blend: float = -1, custom_speed: float = 1.0, from_end: bool = false) -> void

Plays the animation with key `name` and the section starting from `start_time` and ending on `end_time`. See also `play`.
Setting `start_time` to a value outside the range of the animation means the start of the animation will be used instead, and setting `end_time` to a value outside the range of the animation means the end of the animation will be used instead. `start_time` cannot be equal to `end_time`.

> method play_section_backwards(name: StringName = &"", start_time: float = -1, end_time: float = -1, custom_blend: float = -1) -> void

Plays the animation with key `name` and the section starting from `start_time` and ending on `end_time` in reverse.
This method is a shorthand for `play_section` with `custom_speed = -1.0` and `from_end = true`, see its description for more information.

> method play_section_with_markers(name: StringName = &"", start_marker: StringName = &"", end_marker: StringName = &"", custom_blend: float = -1, custom_speed: float = 1.0, from_end: bool = false) -> void

Plays the animation with key `name` and the section starting from `start_marker` and ending on `end_marker`.
If the start marker is empty, the section starts from the beginning of the animation. If the end marker is empty, the section ends on the end of the animation. See also `play`.

> method play_section_with_markers_backwards(name: StringName = &"", start_marker: StringName = &"", end_marker: StringName = &"", custom_blend: float = -1) -> void

Plays the animation with key `name` and the section starting from `start_marker` and ending on `end_marker` in reverse.
This method is a shorthand for `play_section_with_markers` with `custom_speed = -1.0` and `from_end = true`, see its description for more information.

> method play_with_capture(name: StringName = &"", duration: float = -1.0, custom_blend: float = -1, custom_speed: float = 1.0, from_end: bool = false, trans_type: Tween.TransitionType = 0, ease_type: Tween.EaseType = 0) -> void

See also `AnimationMixer.capture`.
You can use this method to use more detailed options for capture than those performed by `playback_auto_capture`. When `playback_auto_capture` is `false`, this method is almost the same as the following:

```text
                capture(name, duration, trans_type, ease_type)
                play(name, custom_blend, custom_speed, from_end)

```

If `name` is blank, it specifies `assigned_animation`.
If `duration` is a negative value, the duration is set to the interval between the current position and the first key, when `from_end` is `true`, uses the interval between the current position and the last key instead.
**Note:** The `duration` takes `speed_scale` into account, but `custom_speed` does not, because the capture cache is interpolated with the blend result and the result may contain multiple animations.

> method queue(name: StringName) -> void

Queues an animation for playback once the current animation and all previously queued animations are done.
**Note:** If a looped animation is currently playing, the queued animation will never play unless the looped animation is stopped somehow.

> method reset_section() -> void

Resets the current section. Does nothing if a section has not been set.

> method seek(seconds: float, update: bool = false, update_only: bool = false) -> void

Seeks the animation to the `seconds` point in time (in seconds). If `update` is `true`, the animation updates too, otherwise it updates at process time. Events between the current frame and `seconds` are skipped.
If `update_only` is `true`, the method / audio / animation playback tracks will not be processed.
**Note:** Seeking to the end of the animation doesn't emit `AnimationMixer.animation_finished`. If you want to skip animation and emit the signal, use `AnimationMixer.advance`.

> method set_blend_time(animation_from: StringName, animation_to: StringName, sec: float) -> void

Specifies a blend time (in seconds) between two animations, referenced by their keys.

> method set_method_call_mode(mode: AnimationMethodCallMode) -> void ; deprecated=Use `AnimationMixer.callback_mode_method` instead.

Sets the call mode used for "Call Method" tracks.

> method set_process_callback(mode: AnimationProcessCallback) -> void ; deprecated=Use `AnimationMixer.callback_mode_process` instead.

Sets the process notification in which to update animations.

> method set_root(path: NodePath) -> void ; deprecated=Use `AnimationMixer.root_node` instead.

Sets the node which node path references will travel from.

> method set_section(start_time: float = -1, end_time: float = -1) -> void

Changes the start and end times of the section being played. The current playback position will be clamped within the new section. See also `play_section`.

> method set_section_with_markers(start_marker: StringName = &"", end_marker: StringName = &"") -> void

Changes the start and end markers of the section being played. The current playback position will be clamped within the new section. See also `play_section_with_markers`.
If the argument is empty, the section uses the beginning or end of the animation. If both are empty, it means that the section is not set.

> method stop(keep_state: bool = false) -> void

Stops the currently playing animation. The animation position is reset to `0` and the `custom_speed` is reset to `1.0`. See also `pause`.
If `keep_state` is `true`, the animation state is not updated visually.
**Note:** The method / audio / animation playback tracks will not be processed by this method.

## Signals

> signal animation_changed(old_name: StringName, new_name: StringName)

Emitted when a queued animation plays after the previous animation finished. See also `AnimationPlayer.queue`.
**Note:** The signal is not emitted when the animation is changed via `AnimationPlayer.play` or by an `AnimationTree`.

> signal current_animation_changed(anim_name: StringName)

Emitted when `current_animation` changes.
