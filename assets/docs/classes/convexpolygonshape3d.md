## Brief

A 3D convex polyhedron shape used for physics collision.

## Description

A 3D convex polyhedron shape, intended for use in physics. Usually used to provide a shape for a `CollisionShape3D`.
`ConvexPolygonShape3D` is *solid*, which means it detects collisions from objects that are fully inside it, unlike `ConcavePolygonShape3D` which is hollow. This makes it more suitable for both detection and physics.
**Convex decomposition:** A concave polyhedron can be split up into several convex polyhedra. This allows dynamic physics bodies to have complex concave collisions (at a performance cost) and can be achieved by using several `ConvexPolygonShape3D` nodes. To generate a convex decomposition from a mesh, select the `MeshInstance3D` node, go to the **Mesh** menu that appears above the viewport, and choose **Create Multiple Convex Collision Siblings**. Alternatively, `MeshInstance3D.create_multiple_convex_collisions` can be called in a script to perform this decomposition at run-time.
**Performance:** `ConvexPolygonShape3D` is faster to check collisions against compared to `ConcavePolygonShape3D`, but it is slower than primitive collision shapes such as `SphereShape3D` and `BoxShape3D`. Its use should generally be limited to medium-sized objects that cannot have their collision accurately represented by primitive shapes.
