# EditorInterface

> class EditorInterface
> inherits EditorInterface Object

## Brief

Godot editor's interface.

## Description

`EditorInterface` gives you control over Godot editor's window. It allows customizing the window, saving and (re-)loading scenes, rendering mesh previews, inspecting and editing resources and objects, and provides access to `EditorSettings`, `EditorFileSystem`, `EditorResourcePreview`, `ScriptEditor`, the editor viewport, and information about scenes.
**Note:** This class shouldn't be instantiated directly. Instead, access the singleton directly by its name.

```gdscript
        var editor_settings = EditorInterface.get_editor_settings()

```

```csharp
        // In C# you can access it via the static Singleton property.
        EditorSettings settings = EditorInterface.Singleton.GetEditorSettings();

```

## Properties

> property distraction_free_mode : bool ; setter=set_distraction_free_mode ; getter=is_distraction_free_mode_enabled

If `true`, enables distraction-free mode which hides side docks to increase the space available for the main view.

> property movie_maker_enabled : bool ; setter=set_movie_maker_enabled ; getter=is_movie_maker_enabled

If `true`, the Movie Maker mode is enabled in the editor. See `MovieWriter` for more information.

## Methods

> method add_root_node(node: Node) -> void

Makes `node` root of the currently opened scene. Only works if the scene is empty. If the `node` is a scene instance, an inheriting scene will be created.

> method close_scene() -> Error

Closes the currently active scene, discarding any pending changes in the process. Returns `OK` on success or `ERR_DOES_NOT_EXIST` if there is no scene to close.

> method edit_node(node: Node) -> void

Edits the given `Node`. The node will be also selected if it's inside the scene tree.

> method edit_resource(resource: Resource) -> void

Edits the given `Resource`. If the resource is a `Script` you can also edit it with `edit_script` to specify the line and column position.

> method edit_script(script: Script, line: int = -1, column: int = 0, grab_focus: bool = true) -> void

Edits the given `Script`. The line and column on which to open the script can also be specified. The script will be open with the user-configured editor for the script's language which may be an external editor.

> method get_base_control() -> Control ; qualifiers=const

Returns the main container of Godot editor's window. For example, you can use it to retrieve the size of the container and place your controls accordingly.
**Warning:** Removing and freeing this node will render the editor useless and may cause a crash.

> method get_command_palette() -> EditorCommandPalette ; qualifiers=const

Returns the editor's `EditorCommandPalette` instance.
**Warning:** Removing and freeing this node will render a part of the editor useless and may cause a crash.

> method get_current_directory() -> String ; qualifiers=const

Returns the current directory being viewed in the `FileSystemDock`. If a file is selected, its base directory will be returned using `String.get_base_dir` instead.

> method get_current_feature_profile() -> String ; qualifiers=const

Returns the name of the currently activated feature profile. If the default profile is currently active, an empty string is returned instead.
In order to get a reference to the `EditorFeatureProfile`, you must load the feature profile using `EditorFeatureProfile.load_from_file`.
**Note:** Feature profiles created via the user interface are loaded from the `feature_profiles` directory, as a file with the `.profile` extension. The editor configuration folder can be found by using `EditorPaths.get_config_dir`.

> method get_current_path() -> String ; qualifiers=const

Returns the current path being viewed in the `FileSystemDock`.

> method get_edited_scene_root() -> Node ; qualifiers=const

Returns the edited (current) scene's root `Node`.

> method get_editor_language() -> String ; qualifiers=const

Returns the language currently used for the editor interface.

> method get_editor_main_screen() -> VBoxContainer ; qualifiers=const

Returns the editor control responsible for main screen plugins and tools. Use it with plugins that implement `EditorPlugin._has_main_screen`.
**Note:** This node is a `VBoxContainer`, which means that if you add a `Control` child to it, you need to set the child's `Control.size_flags_vertical` to `Control.SIZE_EXPAND_FILL` to make it use the full available space.
**Warning:** Removing and freeing this node will render a part of the editor useless and may cause a crash.

> method get_editor_paths() -> EditorPaths ; qualifiers=const

Returns the `EditorPaths` singleton.

> method get_editor_scale() -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the actual scale of the editor UI (`1.0` being 100% scale). This can be used to adjust position and dimensions of the UI added by plugins.
**Note:** This value is set via the `EditorSettings.interface/editor/appearance/display_scale` and `EditorSettings.interface/editor/appearance/custom_display_scale` settings. The editor must be restarted for changes to be properly applied.

> method get_editor_settings() -> EditorSettings ; qualifiers=const

Returns the editor's `EditorSettings` instance.

> method get_editor_theme() -> Theme ; qualifiers=const

Returns the editor's `Theme`.
**Note:** When creating custom editor UI, prefer accessing theme items directly from your GUI nodes using the `get_theme_*` methods.

> method get_editor_toaster() -> EditorToaster ; qualifiers=const

Returns the editor's `EditorToaster`.

> method get_editor_undo_redo() -> EditorUndoRedoManager ; qualifiers=const

Returns the editor's `EditorUndoRedoManager`.

> method get_editor_viewport_2d() -> SubViewport ; qualifiers=const

Returns the 2D editor `SubViewport`. It does not have a camera. Instead, the view transforms are done directly and can be accessed with `Viewport.global_canvas_transform`.

> method get_editor_viewport_3d(idx: int = 0) -> SubViewport ; qualifiers=const

Returns the specified 3D editor `SubViewport`, from `0` to `3`. The viewport can be used to access the active editor cameras with `Viewport.get_camera_3d`.

> method get_file_system_dock() -> FileSystemDock ; qualifiers=const

Returns the editor's `FileSystemDock` instance.
**Warning:** Removing and freeing this node will render a part of the editor useless and may cause a crash.

> method get_inspector() -> EditorInspector ; qualifiers=const

Returns the editor's `EditorInspector` instance.
**Warning:** Removing and freeing this node will render a part of the editor useless and may cause a crash.

> method get_node_3d_rotate_snap() -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the amount of degrees the 3D editor's rotational snapping is set to.

> method get_node_3d_scale_snap() -> float ; qualifiers=const

> method get_unsaved_scenes() -> PackedStringArray ; qualifiers=const

Returns an array of file paths of currently unsaved scenes.

> method inspect_object(object: Object, for_property: String = "", inspector_only: bool = false) -> void

Shows the given property on the given `object` in the editor's Inspector dock. If `inspector_only` is `true`, plugins will not attempt to edit `object`.

> method is_multi_window_enabled() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if multiple window support is enabled in the editor. Multiple window support is enabled if *all* of these statements are true:
- `EditorSettings.interface/multi_window/enable` is `true`.
- `EditorSettings.interface/editor/display/single_window_mode` is `false`.
- `Viewport.gui_embed_subwindows` is `false`. This is forced to `true` on platforms that don't support multiple windows such as Web, or when the `--single-window` [command line argument]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/editor/command_line_tutorial.html) is used.

> method is_node_3d_snap_enabled() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the 3D editor currently has snapping mode enabled, and `false` otherwise.

> method is_object_edited(object: Object) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the object has been marked as edited through `set_object_edited`.

> method play_main_scene() -> void

Plays the main scene.

> method popup_create_dialog(callback: Callable, base_type: StringName = "", current_type: String = "", dialog_title: String = "", type_blocklist: Array[StringName] = []) -> void ; experimental=This method may be changed or removed in future versions.

Pops up an editor dialog for creating an object.
The `callback` must take a single argument of type `String`, which will contain the type name of the selected object (or the script path of the type, if the type is created from a script), or be an empty string if no item is selected.
The `base_type` specifies the base type of objects to display. For example, if you set this to "Resource", all types derived from `Resource` will display in the create dialog.
The `current_type` will be passed in the search box of the create dialog, and the specified type can be immediately selected when the dialog pops up. If the `current_type` is not derived from `base_type`, there will be no result of the type in the dialog.
The `dialog_title` allows you to define a custom title for the dialog. This is useful if you want to accurately hint the usage of the dialog. If the `dialog_title` is an empty string, the dialog will use "Create New 'Base Type'" as the default title.
The `type_blocklist` contains a list of type names, and the types in the blocklist will be hidden from the create dialog.
**Note:** Trying to list the base type in the `type_blocklist` will hide all types derived from the base type from the create dialog.

> method popup_dialog(dialog: Window, rect: Rect2i = Rect2i(0, 0, 0, 0)) -> void

Pops up the `dialog` in the editor UI with `Window.popup_exclusive`. The dialog must have no current parent, otherwise the method fails.
See also `Window.set_unparent_when_invisible`.

> method popup_dialog_centered(dialog: Window, minsize: Vector2i = Vector2i(0, 0)) -> void

Pops up the `dialog` in the editor UI with `Window.popup_exclusive_centered`. The dialog must have no current parent, otherwise the method fails.
See also `Window.set_unparent_when_invisible`.

> method popup_dialog_centered_clamped(dialog: Window, minsize: Vector2i = Vector2i(0, 0), fallback_ratio: float = 0.75) -> void

Pops up the `dialog` in the editor UI with `Window.popup_exclusive_centered_clamped`. The dialog must have no current parent, otherwise the method fails.
See also `Window.set_unparent_when_invisible`.

> method popup_dialog_centered_ratio(dialog: Window, ratio: float = 0.8) -> void

Pops up the `dialog` in the editor UI with `Window.popup_exclusive_centered_ratio`. The dialog must have no current parent, otherwise the method fails.
See also `Window.set_unparent_when_invisible`.

> method popup_method_selector(object: Object, callback: Callable, current_value: String = "") -> void

Pops up an editor dialog for selecting a method from `object`. The `callback` must take a single argument of type `String` which will contain the name of the selected method or be empty if the dialog is canceled. If `current_value` is provided, the method will be selected automatically in the method list, if it exists.

> method popup_node_selector(callback: Callable, valid_types: Array[StringName] = [], current_value: Node = null) -> void

Pops up an editor dialog for selecting a `Node` from the edited scene. The `callback` must take a single argument of type `NodePath`. It is called on the selected `NodePath` or the empty path `^""` if the dialog is canceled. If `valid_types` is provided, the dialog will only show Nodes that match one of the listed Node types. If `current_value` is provided, the Node will be automatically selected in the tree, if it exists.
**Example:** Display the node selection dialog as soon as this node is added to the tree for the first time:

```text
                func _ready():
                    if Engine.is_editor_hint():
                        EditorInterface.popup_node_selector(_on_node_selected, ["Button"])

                func _on_node_selected(node_path):
                    if node_path.is_empty():
                        print("node selection canceled")
                    else:
                        print("selected ", node_path)

```

> method popup_property_selector(object: Object, callback: Callable, type_filter: PackedInt32Array = PackedInt32Array(), current_value: String = "") -> void

Pops up an editor dialog for selecting properties from `object`. The `callback` must take a single argument of type `NodePath`. It is called on the selected property path (see `NodePath.get_as_property_path`) or the empty path `^""` if the dialog is canceled. If `type_filter` is provided, the dialog will only show properties that match one of the listed `Variant.Type` values. If `current_value` is provided, the property will be selected automatically in the property list, if it exists.

```text
                func _ready():
                    if Engine.is_editor_hint():
                        EditorInterface.popup_property_selector(this, _on_property_selected, [TYPE_INT])

                func _on_property_selected(property_path):
                    if property_path.is_empty():
                        print("property selection canceled")
                    else:
                        print("selected ", property_path)

```

> method popup_quick_open(callback: Callable, base_types: Array[StringName] = []) -> void

Pops up an editor dialog for quick selecting a resource file. The `callback` must take a single argument of type `String` which will contain the path of the selected resource or be empty if the dialog is canceled. If `base_types` is provided, the dialog will only show resources that match these types. Only types deriving from `Resource` are supported.

> method reload_scene_from_path(scene_filepath: String) -> void

Reloads the scene at the given path. Fails if the scene is not open.

> method restart_editor(save: bool = true) -> void

Restarts the editor. This closes the editor and then opens the same project. If `save` is `true`, the project will be saved before restarting.

> method save_all_scenes() -> void

Saves all opened scenes in the editor.

> method save_scene() -> Error

Saves the currently active scene. Returns either `OK` or `ERR_CANT_CREATE`.

> method save_scene_as(path: String, with_preview: bool = true) -> void

Saves the currently active scene as a file at `path`.

> method select_file(file: String) -> void

Selects the file, with the path provided by `file`, in the FileSystem dock.

> method set_current_feature_profile(profile_name: String) -> void

Selects and activates the specified feature profile with the given `profile_name`. Set `profile_name` to an empty string to reset to the default feature profile.
A feature profile can be created programmatically using the `EditorFeatureProfile` class.
**Note:** The feature profile that gets activated must be located in the `feature_profiles` directory, as a file with the `.profile` extension. If a profile could not be found, an error occurs. The editor configuration folder can be found by using `EditorPaths.get_config_dir`.

> method set_main_screen_editor(name: String) -> void

Sets the editor's current main screen to the one specified in `name`. `name` must match the title of the tab in question exactly (e.g. `2D`, `3D`, `Script`, `Game`, or `Asset Store` for default tabs).

> method set_object_edited(object: Object, edited: bool) -> void

If `edited` is `true`, the object is marked as edited.
**Note:** This is primarily used by the editor for `Resource` based objects to track their modified state. For example, any changes to an open scene, a resource in the inspector, or an edited script will cause this method to be called with `true`. Saving the scene, script, or resource resets the edited state by calling this method with `false`.
**Note:** Each call to this method increments the object's edited version. This is used to track changes in the editor and to trigger when thumbnails should be regenerated for resources.

> method set_plugin_enabled(plugin: String, enabled: bool) -> void

Sets the enabled status of a plugin. The plugin name is the same as its directory name.

> method stop_playing_scene() -> void

Stops the scene that is currently playing.
