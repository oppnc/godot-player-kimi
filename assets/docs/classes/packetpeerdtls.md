# PacketPeerDTLS

> class PacketPeerDTLS
> inherits PacketPeerDTLS PacketPeer

## Brief

DTLS packet peer.

## Description

This class represents a DTLS peer connection. It can be used to connect to a DTLS server, and is returned by `DTLSServer.take_connection`.
**Note:** When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the `INTERNET` permission in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one-click deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by Android.
**Warning:** TLS certificate revocation and certificate pinning are currently not supported. Revoked certificates are accepted as long as they are otherwise valid. If this is a concern, you may want to use automatically managed certificates with a short validity period.

## Methods

> method connect_to_peer(packet_peer: PacketPeerUDP, hostname: String, client_options: TLSOptions = null) -> Error

Connects a `packet_peer` beginning the DTLS handshake using the underlying `PacketPeerUDP` which must be connected (see `PacketPeerUDP.connect_to_host`). You can optionally specify the `client_options` to be used while verifying the TLS connections. See `TLSOptions.client` and `TLSOptions.client_unsafe`.

> method disconnect_from_peer() -> void

Disconnects this peer, terminating the DTLS session.

> method get_status() -> Status ; qualifiers=const

Returns the status of the connection.

> method poll() -> void

Poll the connection to check for incoming packets. Call this frequently to update the status and keep the connection working.

## Enumerations

> enum Status

> enum_value Status.STATUS_DISCONNECTED = 0

A status representing a `PacketPeerDTLS` that is disconnected.

> enum_value Status.STATUS_HANDSHAKING = 1

A status representing a `PacketPeerDTLS` that is currently performing the handshake with a remote peer.

> enum_value Status.STATUS_CONNECTED = 2

A status representing a `PacketPeerDTLS` that is connected to a remote peer.

> enum_value Status.STATUS_ERROR = 3

A status representing a `PacketPeerDTLS` in a generic error state.

> enum_value Status.STATUS_ERROR_HOSTNAME_MISMATCH = 4

An error status that shows a mismatch in the DTLS certificate domain presented by the host and the domain requested for validation.
