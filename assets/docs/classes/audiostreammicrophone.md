# AudioStreamMicrophone

> class AudioStreamMicrophone
> inherits AudioStreamMicrophone AudioStream

## Brief

Plays real-time audio input data.

## Description

When used directly in an `AudioStreamPlayer` node, `AudioStreamMicrophone` plays back microphone input in real-time. This can be used in conjunction with `AudioEffectCapture` to process the data or save it.
**Note:** `ProjectSettings.audio/driver/enable_input` must be `true` for audio input to work. See also that setting's description for caveats related to permissions and operating system privacy settings.
