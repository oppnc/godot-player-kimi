# IterateIK3D

> class IterateIK3D
> inherits IterateIK3D ChainIK3D

## Brief

A `SkeletonModifier3D` to approach the goal by repeating small rotations.

## Description

Base class of `SkeletonModifier3D` to approach the goal by repeating small rotations.
Each bone chain (setting) has one effector, which is processed in order of the setting list. You can set some limitations for each joint.
**Note:** All the methods in this class take an `index` parameter. This parameter specifies which setting list entry to return if the IK has multiple entries (e.g. `settings/<index>/target_node`).

## Properties

> property angular_delta_limit : float ; default=0.034906585 ; setter=set_angular_delta_limit ; getter=get_angular_delta_limit

The maximum amount each bone can rotate in a single iteration.
**Note:** This limitation is applied during each iteration. For example, if `max_iterations` is `4` and `angular_delta_limit` is `5` degrees, the maximum rotation possible in a single frame is `20` degrees.

> property deterministic : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_deterministic ; getter=is_deterministic

If `false`, the result is calculated from the previous frame's `IterateIK3D` result as the initial state.
If `true`, the previous frame's `IterateIK3D` result is discarded. At this point, the new result is calculated from the bone pose excluding the `IterateIK3D` as the initial state. This means the result will be always equal as long as the target position and the previous bone pose are the same. However, if `angular_delta_limit` and `max_iterations` are set too small, the end bone of the chain will never reach the target.

> property max_iterations : int ; default=4 ; setter=set_max_iterations ; getter=get_max_iterations

The number of iteration loops used by the IK solver to produce more accurate results.

> property min_distance : float ; default=0.001 ; setter=set_min_distance ; getter=get_min_distance

The minimum distance between the end bone and the target. If the distance is below this value, the IK solver stops any further iterations.

> property setting_count : int ; default=0 ; setter=set_setting_count ; getter=get_setting_count

The number of settings.

## Methods

> method get_joint_limitation(index: int, joint: int) -> JointLimitation3D ; qualifiers=const

Returns the joint limitation at `joint` in the bone chain's joint list.

> method get_joint_limitation_right_axis(index: int, joint: int) -> SkeletonModifier3D.SecondaryDirection ; qualifiers=const

Returns the joint limitation right axis at `joint` in the bone chain's joint list.

> method get_joint_limitation_right_axis_vector(index: int, joint: int) -> Vector3 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the joint limitation right axis vector at `joint` in the bone chain's joint list.
If `get_joint_limitation_right_axis` is `SkeletonModifier3D.SECONDARY_DIRECTION_NONE`, this method returns `Vector3(0, 0, 0)`.

> method get_joint_limitation_rotation_offset(index: int, joint: int) -> Quaternion ; qualifiers=const

Returns the joint limitation rotation offset at `joint` in the bone chain's joint list.
Rotation is done in the local space which is constructed by the bone direction (in general parent to child) as the +Y axis and `get_joint_limitation_right_axis_vector` as the +X axis.
If the +X and +Y axes are not orthogonal, the +X axis is implicitly modified to make it orthogonal.
Also, if the length of `get_joint_limitation_right_axis_vector` is zero, the space is created by rotating the reference pose using the shortest arc that rotates the +Y axis of the reference pose to match the bone direction.
In here, the reference pose is the bone pose immediately before processing IK.

> method get_joint_rotation_axis(index: int, joint: int) -> SkeletonModifier3D.RotationAxis ; qualifiers=const

Returns the rotation axis at `joint` in the bone chain's joint list.

> method get_joint_rotation_axis_vector(index: int, joint: int) -> Vector3 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the rotation axis vector for the specified joint in the bone chain. This vector represents the axis around which the joint can rotate. It is determined based on the rotation axis set for the joint.
If `get_joint_rotation_axis` is `SkeletonModifier3D.ROTATION_AXIS_ALL`, this method returns `Vector3(0, 0, 0)`.

> method get_target_node(index: int) -> NodePath ; qualifiers=const

Returns the target node that the end bone is trying to reach.

> method set_joint_limitation(index: int, joint: int, limitation: JointLimitation3D) -> void

Sets the joint limitation at `joint` in the bone chain's joint list.

> method set_joint_limitation_right_axis(index: int, joint: int, direction: SkeletonModifier3D.SecondaryDirection) -> void

Sets the joint limitation right axis at `joint` in the bone chain's joint list.

> method set_joint_limitation_right_axis_vector(index: int, joint: int, vector: Vector3) -> void

Sets the optional joint limitation right axis vector at `joint` in the bone chain's joint list.

> method set_joint_limitation_rotation_offset(index: int, joint: int, offset: Quaternion) -> void

Sets the joint limitation rotation offset at `joint` in the bone chain's joint list.
Rotation is done in the local space which is constructed by the bone direction (in general parent to child) as the +Y axis and `get_joint_limitation_right_axis_vector` as the +X axis.
If the +X and +Y axes are not orthogonal, the +X axis is implicitly modified to make it orthogonal.
Also, if the length of `get_joint_limitation_right_axis_vector` is zero, the space is created by rotating the reference pose using the shortest arc that rotates the +Y axis of the reference pose to match the bone direction.
In here, the reference pose is the bone pose immediately before processing IK.

> method set_joint_rotation_axis(index: int, joint: int, axis: SkeletonModifier3D.RotationAxis) -> void

Sets the rotation axis at `joint` in the bone chain's joint list.
The axes are based on the reference pose's space, if `axis` is `SkeletonModifier3D.ROTATION_AXIS_CUSTOM`, you can specify any axis.
In here, the reference pose is the bone pose immediately before processing IK.
**Note:** The rotation axis and the forward vector shouldn't be colinear to avoid unintended rotation since `ChainIK3D` does not factor in twisting forces.

> method set_joint_rotation_axis_vector(index: int, joint: int, axis_vector: Vector3) -> void

Sets the rotation axis vector for the specified joint in the bone chain.
This vector is normalized by an internal process and represents the axis around which the bone chain can rotate.
If the vector length is `0`, it is considered synonymous with `SkeletonModifier3D.ROTATION_AXIS_ALL`.

> method set_target_node(index: int, target_node: NodePath) -> void

Sets the target node that the end bone is trying to reach.
