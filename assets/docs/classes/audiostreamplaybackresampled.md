# AudioStreamPlaybackResampled

> class AudioStreamPlaybackResampled
> inherits AudioStreamPlaybackResampled AudioStreamPlayback

## Brief

Playback class used for resampled `AudioStream`s.

## Description

Playback class used to mix an `AudioStream`'s audio samples to `AudioServer.get_mix_rate` using cubic interpolation.

## Methods

> method _get_stream_sampling_rate() -> float ; qualifiers=virtual required const

Returns an `AudioStream`'s sample rate, in Hz. Used to perform resampling.

> method _mix_resampled(dst_buffer: AudioFrame*, frame_count: int) -> int ; qualifiers=virtual required

Called by `begin_resample` to mix an `AudioStream` to `AudioServer.get_mix_rate`. Uses `_get_stream_sampling_rate` as the source sample rate. Returns the number of mixed frames.

> method begin_resample() -> void

Called when an `AudioStream` is played. Clears the cubic interpolation history and starts mixing by calling `_mix_resampled`.
