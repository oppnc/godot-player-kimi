# RefCounted

> class RefCounted
> inherits RefCounted Object

## Brief

Base class for reference-counted objects.

## Description

Base class for any object that keeps a reference count. `Resource` and many other helper objects inherit this class.
Unlike other `Object` types, `RefCounted`s keep an internal reference counter so that they are automatically released when no longer in use, and only then. `RefCounted`s therefore do not need to be freed manually with `Object.free`.
`RefCounted` instances caught in a cyclic reference will **not** be freed automatically. For example, if a node holds a reference to instance `A`, which directly or indirectly holds a reference back to `A`, `A`'s reference count will be 2. Destruction of the node will leave `A` dangling with a reference count of 1, and there will be a memory leak. To prevent this, one of the references in the cycle can be made weak with `@GlobalScope.weakref`.
In the vast majority of use cases, instantiating and using `RefCounted`-derived types is all you need to do. The methods provided in this class are only for advanced users, and can cause issues if misused.
**Note:** In C#, reference-counted objects will not be freed instantly after they are no longer in use. Instead, garbage collection will run periodically and will free reference-counted objects that are no longer in use. This means that unused ones will remain in memory for a while before being removed.

## Methods

> method get_reference_count() -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the current reference count.

> method init_ref() -> bool

Initializes the internal reference counter. Use this only if you really know what you are doing.
Returns whether the initialization was successful.

> method reference() -> bool

Increments the internal reference counter. Use this only if you really know what you are doing.
Returns `true` if the increment was successful, `false` otherwise.

> method unreference() -> bool

Decrements the internal reference counter. Use this only if you really know what you are doing.
Returns `true` if the object should be freed after the decrement, `false` otherwise.
