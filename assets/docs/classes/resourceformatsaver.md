# ResourceFormatSaver

> class ResourceFormatSaver
> inherits ResourceFormatSaver RefCounted

## Brief

Saves a specific resource type to a file.

## Description

The engine can save resources when you do it from the editor, or when you use the `ResourceSaver` singleton. This is accomplished thanks to multiple `ResourceFormatSaver`s, each handling its own format and called automatically by the engine.
By default, Godot saves resources as `.tres` (text-based), `.res` (binary) or another built-in format, but you can choose to create your own format by extending this class. Be sure to respect the documented return types and values. You should give it a global class name with `class_name` for it to be registered. Like built-in ResourceFormatSavers, it will be called automatically when saving resources of its recognized type(s). You may also implement a `ResourceFormatLoader`.

## Methods

> method _get_recognized_extensions(resource: Resource) -> PackedStringArray ; qualifiers=virtual const

Returns the list of extensions available for saving the resource object, provided it is recognized (see `_recognize`).

> method _recognize(resource: Resource) -> bool ; qualifiers=virtual const

Returns whether the given resource object can be saved by this saver.

> method _recognize_path(resource: Resource, path: String) -> bool ; qualifiers=virtual const

Returns `true` if this saver handles a given save path and `false` otherwise.
If this method is not implemented, the default behavior returns whether the path's extension is within the ones provided by `_get_recognized_extensions`.

> method _save(resource: Resource, path: String, flags: int) -> Error ; qualifiers=virtual

Saves the given resource object to a file at the target `path`. `flags` is a bitmask composed with `ResourceSaver.SaverFlags` constants.
Returns `OK` on success, or an `Error` constant in case of failure.

> method _set_uid(path: String, uid: int) -> Error ; qualifiers=virtual

Sets a new UID for the resource at the given `path`. Returns `OK` on success, or an `Error` constant in case of failure.
