# Plane

> class Plane

## Brief

A plane in Hessian normal form.

## Description

Represents a normalized plane equation. `normal` is the normal of the plane (a, b, c normalized), and `d` is the distance from the origin to the plane (in the direction of "normal"). "Over" or "Above" the plane is considered the side of the plane towards where the normal is pointing.
**Note:** In a boolean context, a plane will evaluate to `false` if all its components equal `0`. Otherwise, a plane will always evaluate to `true`.

## Properties

> property d : float ; default=0.0

The distance from the origin to the plane, expressed in terms of `normal` (according to its direction and magnitude). Actual absolute distance from the origin to the plane can be calculated as `abs(d) / normal.length()` (if `normal` has zero length then this `Plane` does not represent a valid plane).
In the scalar equation of the plane `ax + by + cz = d`, this is `d`, while the `(a, b, c)` coordinates are represented by the `normal` property.

> property normal : Vector3 ; default=Vector3(0, 0, 0)

The normal of the plane, typically a unit vector. Shouldn't be a zero vector as `Plane` with such `normal` does not represent a valid plane.
In the scalar equation of the plane `ax + by + cz = d`, this is the vector `(a, b, c)`, where `d` is the `d` property.

> property x : float ; default=0.0

The X component of the plane's `normal` vector.

> property y : float ; default=0.0

The Y component of the plane's `normal` vector.

> property z : float ; default=0.0

The Z component of the plane's `normal` vector.

## Constructors

> constructor Plane()

Constructs a default-initialized `Plane` with all components set to `0`.

> constructor Plane(from: Plane)

Constructs a `Plane` as a copy of the given `Plane`.

> constructor Plane(a: float, b: float, c: float, d: float)

Creates a plane from the four parameters. The three components of the resulting plane's `normal` are `a`, `b` and `c`, and the plane has a distance of `d` from the origin.

> constructor Plane(normal: Vector3)

Creates a plane from the normal vector. The plane will intersect the origin.
The `normal` of the plane must be a unit vector.

> constructor Plane(normal: Vector3, d: float)

Creates a plane from the normal vector and the plane's distance from the origin.
The `normal` of the plane must be a unit vector.

> constructor Plane(normal: Vector3, point: Vector3)

Creates a plane from the normal vector and a point on the plane.
The `normal` of the plane must be a unit vector.

> constructor Plane(point1: Vector3, point2: Vector3, point3: Vector3)

Creates a plane from the three points, given in clockwise order.

## Methods

> method distance_to(point: Vector3) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the shortest distance from the plane to the position `point`. If the point is above the plane, the distance will be positive. If below, the distance will be negative.

> method get_center() -> Vector3 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the center of the plane.

> method has_point(point: Vector3, tolerance: float = 1e-05) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if `point` is inside the plane. Comparison uses a custom minimum `tolerance` threshold.

> method intersect_3(b: Plane, c: Plane) -> Variant ; qualifiers=const

Returns the intersection point of the three planes `b`, `c` and this plane. If no intersection is found, `null` is returned.

> method intersects_ray(from: Vector3, dir: Vector3) -> Variant ; qualifiers=const

Returns the intersection point of a ray consisting of the position `from` and the direction normal `dir` with this plane. If no intersection is found, `null` is returned.

> method intersects_segment(from: Vector3, to: Vector3) -> Variant ; qualifiers=const

Returns the intersection point of a segment from position `from` to position `to` with this plane. If no intersection is found, `null` is returned.

> method is_equal_approx(to_plane: Plane) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this plane and `to_plane` are approximately equal, by running `@GlobalScope.is_equal_approx` on each component.

> method is_finite() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this plane is finite, by calling `@GlobalScope.is_finite` on each component.

> method is_point_over(point: Vector3) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if `point` is located above the plane.

> method normalized() -> Plane ; qualifiers=const

Returns a copy of the plane, with normalized `normal` (so it's a unit vector). Returns `Plane(0, 0, 0, 0)` if `normal` can't be normalized (it has zero length).

> method project(point: Vector3) -> Vector3 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the orthogonal projection of `point` into a point in the plane.

## Operators

> operator !=(right: Plane) -> bool

Returns `true` if the planes are not equal.
**Note:** Due to floating-point precision errors, consider using `is_equal_approx` instead, which is more reliable.

> operator *(right: Transform3D) -> Plane

Inversely transforms (multiplies) the `Plane` by the given `Transform3D` transformation matrix.
`plane * transform` is equivalent to `transform.affine_inverse() * plane`. See `Transform3D.affine_inverse`.

> operator ==(right: Plane) -> bool

Returns `true` if the planes are exactly equal.
**Note:** Due to floating-point precision errors, consider using `is_equal_approx` instead, which is more reliable.

> operator unary+() -> Plane

Returns the same value as if the `+` was not there. Unary `+` does nothing, but sometimes it can make your code more readable.

> operator unary-() -> Plane

Returns the negative value of the `Plane`. This is the same as writing `Plane(-p.normal, -p.d)`. This operation flips the direction of the normal vector and also flips the distance value, resulting in a Plane that is in the same place, but facing the opposite direction.

## Constants

> constant PLANE_YZ = Plane(1, 0, 0, 0)

A plane that extends in the Y and Z axes (normal vector points +X).

> constant PLANE_XZ = Plane(0, 1, 0, 0)

A plane that extends in the X and Z axes (normal vector points +Y).

> constant PLANE_XY = Plane(0, 0, 1, 0)

A plane that extends in the X and Y axes (normal vector points +Z).
