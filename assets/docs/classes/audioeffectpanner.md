## Description

Determines how much of the audio signal is sent to the left and right channels. This helps with audio spatialization, giving sounds distinct places in a mix.
`AudioStreamPlayer2D` and `AudioStreamPlayer3D` handle panning automatically, following where the source of the sound is on the screen.

## Properties

> property pan : float ; default=0.0 ; setter=set_pan ; getter=get_pan

Pan position. Negative values pan the sound to the left, positive pan to the right. Value can range from -1 to 1.
