# InstancePlaceholder

> class InstancePlaceholder
> inherits InstancePlaceholder Node

## Brief

Placeholder for the root `Node` of a `PackedScene`.

## Description

Turning on the option **Load As Placeholder** for an instantiated scene in the editor causes it to be replaced by an `InstancePlaceholder` when running the game, this will not replace the node in the editor. This makes it possible to delay actually loading the scene until calling `create_instance`. This is useful to avoid loading large scenes all at once by loading parts of it selectively.
**Note:** Like `Node`, `InstancePlaceholder` does not have a transform. This causes any child nodes to be positioned relatively to the `Viewport` origin, rather than their parent as displayed in the editor. Replacing the placeholder with a scene with a transform will transform children relatively to their parent again.

## Methods

> method create_instance(replace: bool = false, custom_scene: PackedScene = null) -> Node

Call this method to actually load in the node. The created node will be placed as a sibling *above* the `InstancePlaceholder` in the scene tree. The `Node`'s reference is also returned for convenience.
**Note:** `create_instance` is not thread-safe. Use `Object.call_deferred` if calling from a thread.

> method get_instance_path() -> String ; qualifiers=const

Gets the path to the `PackedScene` resource file that is loaded by default when calling `create_instance`. Not thread-safe. Use `Object.call_deferred` if calling from a thread.

> method get_stored_values(with_order: bool = false) -> Dictionary

Returns the list of properties that will be applied to the node when `create_instance` is called.
If `with_order` is `true`, a key named `.order` (note the leading period) is added to the dictionary. This `.order` key is an `Array` of `String` property names specifying the order in which properties will be applied (with index 0 being the first).
