# ResourceImporterBitMap

> class ResourceImporterBitMap
> inherits ResourceImporterBitMap ResourceImporter

## Brief

Imports a `BitMap` resource (2D array of boolean values).

## Description

`BitMap` resources are typically used as click masks in `TextureButton` and `TouchScreenButton`.

## Properties

> property create_from : int ; default=0

The data source to use for generating the bitmap.
**Black & White:** Pixels whose HSV value is greater than the `threshold` will be considered as "enabled" (bit is `true`). If the pixel is lower than or equal to the threshold, it will be considered as "disabled" (bit is `false`).
**Alpha:** Pixels whose alpha value is greater than the `threshold` will be considered as "enabled" (bit is `true`). If the pixel is lower than or equal to the threshold, it will be considered as "disabled" (bit is `false`).

> property threshold : float ; default=0.5

The threshold to use to determine which bits should be considered enabled or disabled. See also `create_from`.
