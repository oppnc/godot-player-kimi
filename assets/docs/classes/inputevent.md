# InputEvent

> class InputEvent
> inherits InputEvent Resource

## Brief

Abstract base class for input events.

## Description

Abstract base class of all types of input events. See `Node._input`.

## Properties

> property device : int ; default=0 ; setter=set_device ; getter=get_device

The event's device ID.
**Note:** `device` can be negative for special use cases that don't refer to devices physically present on the system. See `DEVICE_ID_EMULATION`.

## Methods

> method accumulate(with_event: InputEvent) -> bool

Returns `true` if the given input event and this input event can be added together (only for events of type `InputEventMouseMotion`).
The given input event's position, global position and speed will be copied. The resulting `relative` is a sum of both events. Both events' modifiers have to be identical.

> method as_text() -> String ; qualifiers=const

Returns a `String` representation of the event.

> method get_action_strength(action: StringName, exact_match: bool = false) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns a value between 0.0 and 1.0 depending on the given actions' state. Useful for getting the value of events of type `InputEventJoypadMotion`.
If `exact_match` is `false`, it ignores additional input modifiers for `InputEventKey` and `InputEventMouseButton` events, and the direction for `InputEventJoypadMotion` events.

> method is_action(action: StringName, exact_match: bool = false) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this input event matches a pre-defined action of any type.
If `exact_match` is `false`, it ignores additional input modifiers for `InputEventKey` and `InputEventMouseButton` events, and the direction for `InputEventJoypadMotion` events.

> method is_action_pressed(action: StringName, allow_echo: bool = false, exact_match: bool = false) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the given action matches this event and is being pressed (and is not an echo event for `InputEventKey` events, unless `allow_echo` is `true`). Not relevant for events of type `InputEventMouseMotion` or `InputEventScreenDrag`.
If `exact_match` is `false`, it ignores additional input modifiers for `InputEventKey` and `InputEventMouseButton` events, and the direction for `InputEventJoypadMotion` events.
**Note:** Due to keyboard ghosting, `is_action_pressed` may return `false` even if one of the action's keys is pressed. See [Input examples]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/inputs/input_examples.html#keyboard-events) in the documentation for more information.

> method is_action_released(action: StringName, exact_match: bool = false) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the given action matches this event and is released (i.e. not pressed). Not relevant for events of type `InputEventMouseMotion` or `InputEventScreenDrag`.
If `exact_match` is `false`, it ignores additional input modifiers for `InputEventKey` and `InputEventMouseButton` events, and the direction for `InputEventJoypadMotion` events.

> method is_action_type() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this input event's type is one that can be assigned to an input action: `InputEventKey`, `InputEventMouseButton`, `InputEventJoypadButton`, `InputEventJoypadMotion`, `InputEventAction`. Returns `false` for all other input event types.

> method is_canceled() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this input event has been canceled.

> method is_echo() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this input event is an echo event (only for events of type `InputEventKey`). An echo event is a repeated key event sent when the user is holding down the key. Any other event type returns `false`.
**Note:** The rate at which echo events are sent is typically around 20 events per second (after holding down the key for roughly half a second). However, the key repeat delay/speed can be changed by the user or disabled entirely in the operating system settings. To ensure your project works correctly on all configurations, do not assume the user has a specific key repeat configuration in your project's behavior.

> method is_match(event: InputEvent, exact_match: bool = true) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the specified `event` matches this event. Only valid for action events, which include key (`InputEventKey`), button (`InputEventMouseButton` or `InputEventJoypadButton`), axis `InputEventJoypadMotion`, and action (`InputEventAction`) events.
If `exact_match` is `false`, the check ignores additional input modifiers for `InputEventKey` and `InputEventMouseButton` events, and the direction for `InputEventJoypadMotion` events.
**Note:** This method only considers the event configuration (such as the keyboard key or the joypad axis), not state information like `is_pressed`, `is_released`, `is_echo`, or `is_canceled`.

> method is_pressed() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this input event is pressed. Not relevant for events of type `InputEventMouseMotion` or `InputEventScreenDrag`.
**Note:** Due to keyboard ghosting, `is_pressed` may return `false` even if one of the action's keys is pressed. See [Input examples]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/inputs/input_examples.html#keyboard-events) in the documentation for more information.

> method is_released() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this input event is released. Not relevant for events of type `InputEventMouseMotion` or `InputEventScreenDrag`.

> method xformed_by(xform: Transform2D, local_ofs: Vector2 = Vector2(0, 0)) -> InputEvent ; qualifiers=const

Returns a copy of the given input event which has been offset by `local_ofs` and transformed by `xform`. Relevant for events of type `InputEventMouseButton`, `InputEventMouseMotion`, `InputEventScreenTouch`, `InputEventScreenDrag`, `InputEventMagnifyGesture` and `InputEventPanGesture`.

## Constants

> constant DEVICE_ID_EMULATION = -1

Device ID used for emulated mouse input from a touchscreen, or for emulated touch input from a mouse. This can be used to distinguish emulated mouse input from physical mouse input, or emulated touch input from physical touch input.

> constant DEVICE_ID_KEYBOARD = 16

Device ID used for input from a keyboard. This can be used to distinguish keyboard input events from joypad input events.

> constant DEVICE_ID_MOUSE = 32

Device ID used for input from a mouse. This can be used to distinguish mouse input events from joypad input events.
