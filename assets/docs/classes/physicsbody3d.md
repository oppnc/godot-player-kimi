## Brief

Abstract base class for 3D game objects affected by physics.

## Description

`PhysicsBody3D` is an abstract base class for 3D game objects affected by physics. All 3D physics bodies inherit from it.
**Warning:** With a non-uniform scale, this node will likely not behave as expected. It is advised to keep its scale the same on all axes and adjust its collision shape(s) instead.

## Properties

> property axis_lock_angular_x : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_axis_lock ; getter=get_axis_lock

Lock the body's rotation in the X axis.

> property axis_lock_angular_y : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_axis_lock ; getter=get_axis_lock

Lock the body's rotation in the Y axis.

> property axis_lock_angular_z : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_axis_lock ; getter=get_axis_lock

Lock the body's rotation in the Z axis.

> property axis_lock_linear_x : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_axis_lock ; getter=get_axis_lock

Lock the body's linear movement in the X axis.

> property axis_lock_linear_y : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_axis_lock ; getter=get_axis_lock

Lock the body's linear movement in the Y axis.

> property axis_lock_linear_z : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_axis_lock ; getter=get_axis_lock

Lock the body's linear movement in the Z axis.

## Methods

> method add_collision_exception_with(body: Node) -> void

Adds a body to the list of bodies that this body can't collide with.

> method get_axis_lock(axis: PhysicsServer3D.BodyAxis) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the specified linear or rotational `axis` is locked.

> method get_collision_exceptions() -> Array[PhysicsBody3D]

Returns an array of nodes that were added as collision exceptions for this body.

> method get_gravity() -> Vector3 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the gravity vector computed from all sources that can affect the body, including all gravity overrides from `Area3D` nodes and the global world gravity.

> method move_and_collide(motion: Vector3, test_only: bool = false, safe_margin: float = 0.001, recovery_as_collision: bool = false, max_collisions: int = 1) -> KinematicCollision3D

Moves the body along the vector `motion`. In order to be frame rate independent in `Node._physics_process` or `Node._process`, `motion` should be computed using `delta`.
The body will stop if it collides. Returns a `KinematicCollision3D`, which contains information about the collision when stopped, or when touching another body along the motion.
If `test_only` is `true`, the body does not move but the would-be collision information is given.
`safe_margin` is the extra margin used for collision recovery (see `CharacterBody3D.safe_margin` for more details).
If `recovery_as_collision` is `true`, any depenetration from the recovery phase is also reported as a collision; this is used e.g. by `CharacterBody3D` for improving floor detection during floor snapping.
`max_collisions` allows to retrieve more than one collision result.

> method remove_collision_exception_with(body: Node) -> void

Removes a body from the list of bodies that this body can't collide with.

> method set_axis_lock(axis: PhysicsServer3D.BodyAxis, lock: bool) -> void

Locks or unlocks the specified linear or rotational `axis` depending on the value of `lock`.

> method test_move(from: Transform3D, motion: Vector3, collision: KinematicCollision3D = null, safe_margin: float = 0.001, recovery_as_collision: bool = false, max_collisions: int = 1) -> bool

Checks for collisions without moving the body. In order to be frame rate independent in `Node._physics_process` or `Node._process`, `motion` should be computed using `delta`.
Virtually sets the node's position, scale and rotation to that of the given `Transform3D`, then tries to move the body along the vector `motion`. Returns `true` if a collision would stop the body from moving along the whole path.
`collision` is an optional object of type `KinematicCollision3D`, which contains additional information about the collision when stopped, or when touching another body along the motion.
`safe_margin` is the extra margin used for collision recovery (see `CharacterBody3D.safe_margin` for more details).
If `recovery_as_collision` is `true`, any depenetration from the recovery phase is also reported as a collision; this is useful for checking whether the body would *touch* any other bodies.
`max_collisions` allows to retrieve more than one collision result.
