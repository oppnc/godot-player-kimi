# PCKPacker

> class PCKPacker
> inherits PCKPacker RefCounted

## Brief

Creates packages that can be loaded into a running project.

## Description

The `PCKPacker` is used to create packages that can be loaded into a running project using `ProjectSettings.load_resource_pack`.

```gdscript
        var packer = PCKPacker.new()
        packer.pck_start("test.pck")
        packer.add_file("res://text.txt", "text.txt")
        packer.flush()

```

```csharp
        var packer = new PckPacker();
        packer.PckStart("test.pck");
        packer.AddFile("res://text.txt", "text.txt");
        packer.Flush();

```

The above `PCKPacker` creates package `test.pck`, then adds a file named `text.txt` at the root of the package.
**Note:** PCK is Godot's own pack file format. To create ZIP archives that can be read by any program, use `ZIPPacker` instead.

## Methods

> method add_file(target_path: String, source_path: String, encrypt: bool = false) -> Error

Adds the `source_path` file to the current PCK package at the `target_path` internal path. The `res://` prefix for `target_path` is optional and stripped internally. File content is immediately written to the PCK.

> method add_file_from_buffer(target_path: String, data: PackedByteArray, encrypt: bool = false) -> Error

Adds the `data` to the current PCK package at the `target_path` internal path. The `res://` prefix for `target_path` is optional and stripped internally. File content is immediately written to the PCK.

> method add_file_removal(target_path: String) -> Error

Registers a file removal of the `target_path` internal path to the PCK. This is mainly used for patches. If the file at this path has been loaded from a previous PCK, it will be removed. The `res://` prefix for `target_path` is optional and stripped internally.

> method flush(verbose: bool = false) -> Error

Writes the file directory and closes the PCK. If `verbose` is `true`, a list of files added will be printed to the console for easier debugging.
**Note:** `PCKPacker` will automatically flush when it's freed, which happens when it goes out of scope or when it gets assigned with `null`. In C# the reference must be disposed after use, either with the `using` statement or by calling the `Dispose` method directly.

> method pck_start(pck_path: String, alignment: int = 32, key: String = "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000", encrypt_directory: bool = false) -> Error

Creates a new PCK file at the file path `pck_path`. The `.pck` file extension isn't added automatically, so it should be part of `pck_path` (even though it's not required).
