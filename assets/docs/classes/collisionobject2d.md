# CollisionObject2D

> class CollisionObject2D
> inherits CollisionObject2D Node2D

## Brief

Abstract base class for 2D physics objects.

## Description

Abstract base class for 2D physics objects. `CollisionObject2D` can hold any number of `Shape2D`s for collision. Each shape must be assigned to a *shape owner*. Shape owners are not nodes and do not appear in the editor, but are accessible through code using the `shape_owner_*` methods.
**Note:** Only collisions between objects within the same canvas (`Viewport` canvas or `CanvasLayer`) are supported. The behavior of collisions between objects in different canvases is undefined.

## Properties

> property collision_layer : int ; default=1 ; setter=set_collision_layer ; getter=get_collision_layer

The physics layers this CollisionObject2D is in. Collision objects can exist in one or more of 32 different layers. See also `collision_mask`.
**Note:** Object A can detect a contact with object B only if object B is in any of the layers that object A scans. See [Collision layers and masks]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/physics/physics_introduction.html#collision-layers-and-masks) in the documentation for more information.

> property collision_mask : int ; default=1 ; setter=set_collision_mask ; getter=get_collision_mask

The physics layers this CollisionObject2D scans. Collision objects can scan one or more of 32 different layers. See also `collision_layer`.
**Note:** Object A can detect a contact with object B only if object B is in any of the layers that object A scans. See [Collision layers and masks]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/physics/physics_introduction.html#collision-layers-and-masks) in the documentation for more information.

> property collision_priority : float ; default=1.0 ; setter=set_collision_priority ; getter=get_collision_priority

The priority used to solve colliding when occurring penetration. The higher the priority is, the lower the penetration into the object will be. This can for example be used to prevent the player from breaking through the boundaries of a level.

> property disable_mode : DisableMode ; default=0 ; setter=set_disable_mode ; getter=get_disable_mode

Defines the behavior in physics when `Node.process_mode` is set to `Node.PROCESS_MODE_DISABLED`.

> property input_pickable : bool ; default=true ; setter=set_pickable ; getter=is_pickable

If `true`, this object is pickable. A pickable object can detect the mouse pointer entering/leaving, and if the mouse is inside it, report input events. Requires at least one `collision_layer` bit to be set.

## Methods

> method _input_event(viewport: Viewport, event: InputEvent, shape_idx: int) -> void ; qualifiers=virtual

Accepts unhandled `InputEvent`s. `shape_idx` is the child index of the clicked `Shape2D`. Connect to `input_event` to easily pick up these events.
**Note:** `_input_event` requires `input_pickable` to be `true` and at least one `collision_layer` bit to be set.

> method _mouse_enter() -> void ; qualifiers=virtual

Called when the mouse pointer enters any of this object's shapes. Requires `input_pickable` to be `true` and at least one `collision_layer` bit to be set. Note that moving between different shapes within a single `CollisionObject2D` won't cause this function to be called.

> method _mouse_exit() -> void ; qualifiers=virtual

Called when the mouse pointer exits all this object's shapes. Requires `input_pickable` to be `true` and at least one `collision_layer` bit to be set. Note that moving between different shapes within a single `CollisionObject2D` won't cause this function to be called.

> method _mouse_shape_enter(shape_idx: int) -> void ; qualifiers=virtual

Called when the mouse pointer enters any of this object's shapes or moves from one shape to another. `shape_idx` is the child index of the newly entered `Shape2D`. Requires `input_pickable` to be `true` and at least one `collision_layer` bit to be called.

> method _mouse_shape_exit(shape_idx: int) -> void ; qualifiers=virtual

Called when the mouse pointer exits any of this object's shapes. `shape_idx` is the child index of the exited `Shape2D`. Requires `input_pickable` to be `true` and at least one `collision_layer` bit to be called.

## Signals

> signal input_event(viewport: Node, event: InputEvent, shape_idx: int)

Emitted when an input event occurs. Requires `input_pickable` to be `true` and at least one `collision_layer` bit to be set. See `_input_event` for details.

> signal mouse_entered()

Emitted when the mouse pointer enters any of this object's shapes. Requires `input_pickable` to be `true` and at least one `collision_layer` bit to be set. Note that moving between different shapes within a single `CollisionObject2D` won't cause this signal to be emitted.
**Note:** Due to the lack of continuous collision detection, this signal may not be emitted in the expected order if the mouse moves fast enough and the `CollisionObject2D`'s area is small. This signal may also not be emitted if another `CollisionObject2D` is overlapping the `CollisionObject2D` in question.

> signal mouse_exited()

Emitted when the mouse pointer exits all this object's shapes. Requires `input_pickable` to be `true` and at least one `collision_layer` bit to be set. Note that moving between different shapes within a single `CollisionObject2D` won't cause this signal to be emitted.
**Note:** Due to the lack of continuous collision detection, this signal may not be emitted in the expected order if the mouse moves fast enough and the `CollisionObject2D`'s area is small. This signal may also not be emitted if another `CollisionObject2D` is overlapping the `CollisionObject2D` in question.

> signal mouse_shape_entered(shape_idx: int)

Emitted when the mouse pointer enters any of this object's shapes or moves from one shape to another. `shape_idx` is the child index of the newly entered `Shape2D`. Requires `input_pickable` to be `true` and at least one `collision_layer` bit to be set.

> signal mouse_shape_exited(shape_idx: int)

Emitted when the mouse pointer exits any of this object's shapes. `shape_idx` is the child index of the exited `Shape2D`. Requires `input_pickable` to be `true` and at least one `collision_layer` bit to be set.

## Enumerations

> enum DisableMode

> enum_value DisableMode.DISABLE_MODE_REMOVE = 0

When `Node.process_mode` is set to `Node.PROCESS_MODE_DISABLED`, remove from the physics simulation to stop all physics interactions with this `CollisionObject2D`.
Automatically re-added to the physics simulation when the `Node` is processed again.

> enum_value DisableMode.DISABLE_MODE_MAKE_STATIC = 1

When `Node.process_mode` is set to `Node.PROCESS_MODE_DISABLED`, make the body static. Doesn't affect `Area2D`. `PhysicsBody2D` can't be affected by forces or other bodies while static.
Automatically set `PhysicsBody2D` back to its original mode when the `Node` is processed again.

> enum_value DisableMode.DISABLE_MODE_KEEP_ACTIVE = 2

When `Node.process_mode` is set to `Node.PROCESS_MODE_DISABLED`, do not affect the physics simulation.
