# Projection

> class Projection

## Brief

A 4×4 matrix for 3D projective transformations.

## Description

A 4×4 matrix used for 3D projective transformations. It can represent transformations such as translation, rotation, scaling, shearing, and perspective division. It consists of four `Vector4` columns.
For purely linear transformations (translation, rotation, and scale), it is recommended to use `Transform3D`, as it is more performant and requires less memory.
Used internally as `Camera3D`'s projection matrix.
**Note:** In a boolean context, a projection will evaluate to `false` if it's equal to `IDENTITY`. Otherwise, a projection will always evaluate to `true`.

## Properties

> property w : Vector4 ; default=Vector4(0, 0, 0, 1)

The projection matrix's W vector (column 3). Equivalent to array index `3`.

> property x : Vector4 ; default=Vector4(1, 0, 0, 0)

The projection matrix's X vector (column 0). Equivalent to array index `0`.

> property y : Vector4 ; default=Vector4(0, 1, 0, 0)

The projection matrix's Y vector (column 1). Equivalent to array index `1`.

> property z : Vector4 ; default=Vector4(0, 0, 1, 0)

The projection matrix's Z vector (column 2). Equivalent to array index `2`.

## Constructors

The projection is adjusted for a head-mounted display with the given distance between eyes and distance to a point that can be focused on.
`eye` creates the projection for the left eye when set to 1, or the right eye when set to 2.
`flip_fov` determines whether the projection's field of view is flipped over its diagonal.

> method determinant() -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns a scalar value that is the signed factor by which areas are scaled by this matrix. If the sign is negative, the matrix flips the orientation of the area.
The determinant can be used to calculate the invertibility of a matrix or solve linear systems of equations involving the matrix, among other applications.

> method flipped_y() -> Projection ; qualifiers=const

Returns a copy of this `Projection` with the signs of the values of the Y column flipped.

> method get_fovy(fovx: float, aspect: float) -> float ; qualifiers=static

Returns the vertical field of view of the projection (in degrees) associated with the given horizontal field of view (in degrees) and aspect ratio.
**Note:** Unlike most methods of `Projection`, `aspect` is expected to be 1 divided by the X:Y aspect ratio.

**Note:** The original `Projection` must be a perspective projection.

## Operators

> operator !=(right: Projection) -> bool

Returns `true` if the projections are not equal.
