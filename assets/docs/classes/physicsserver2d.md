# PhysicsServer2D

> class PhysicsServer2D
> inherits PhysicsServer2D Object

## Brief

A server interface for low-level 2D physics access.

## Description

PhysicsServer2D is the server responsible for all 2D physics. It can directly create and manipulate all physics objects:
- A *space* is a self-contained world for a physics simulation. It contains bodies, areas, and joints. Its state can be queried for collision and intersection information, and several parameters of the simulation can be modified.
- A *shape* is a geometric shape such as a circle, a rectangle, a capsule, or a polygon. It can be used for collision detection by adding it to a body/area, possibly with an extra transformation relative to the body/area's origin. Bodies/areas can have multiple (transformed) shapes added to them, and a single shape can be added to bodies/areas multiple times with different local transformations.
- A *body* is a physical object which can be in static, kinematic, or rigid mode. Its state (such as position and velocity) can be queried and updated. A force integration callback can be set to customize the body's physics.
- An *area* is a region in space which can be used to detect bodies and areas entering and exiting it. A body monitoring callback can be set to report entering/exiting body shapes, and similarly an area monitoring callback can be set. Gravity and damping can be overridden within the area by setting area parameters.
- A *joint* is a constraint, either between two bodies or on one body relative to a point. Parameters such as the joint bias and the rest length of a spring joint can be adjusted.
Physics objects in `PhysicsServer2D` may be created and manipulated independently; they do not have to be tied to nodes in the scene tree.
**Note:** All the 2D physics nodes use the physics server internally. Adding a physics node to the scene tree will cause a corresponding physics object to be created in the physics server. A rigid body node registers a callback that updates the node's transform with the transform of the respective body object in the physics server (every physics update). An area node registers a callback to inform the area node about overlaps with the respective area object in the physics server. The raycast node queries the direct state of the relevant space in the physics server.

## Methods

> method area_add_shape(area: RID, shape: RID, transform: Transform2D = Transform2D(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0), disabled: bool = false) -> void

Adds a shape to the area, with the given local transform. The shape (together with its `transform` and `disabled` properties) is added to an array of shapes, and the shapes of an area are usually referenced by their index in this array.

> method area_attach_canvas_instance_id(area: RID, id: int) -> void

Attaches the `ObjectID` of a canvas to the area. Use `Object.get_instance_id` to get the `ObjectID` of a `CanvasLayer`.

> method area_attach_object_instance_id(area: RID, id: int) -> void

Attaches the `ObjectID` of an `Object` to the area. Use `Object.get_instance_id` to get the `ObjectID` of a `CollisionObject2D`.

> method area_clear_shapes(area: RID) -> void

Removes all shapes from the area. This does not delete the shapes themselves, so they can continue to be used elsewhere or added back later.

> method area_create() -> RID

Creates a 2D area object in the physics server, and returns the `RID` that identifies it. The default settings for the created area include a collision layer and mask set to `1`, and `monitorable` set to `false`.
Use `area_add_shape` to add shapes to it, use `area_set_transform` to set its transform, and use `area_set_space` to add the area to a space. If you want the area to be detectable use `area_set_monitorable`.

> method area_get_canvas_instance_id(area: RID) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the `ObjectID` of the canvas attached to the area. Use `@GlobalScope.instance_from_id` to retrieve a `CanvasLayer` from a nonzero `ObjectID`.

Returns the transform matrix of the area.

> method area_remove_shape(area: RID, shape_idx: int) -> void

Removes the shape with the given index from the area's array of shapes. The shape itself is not deleted, so it can continue to be used elsewhere or added back later. As a result of this operation, the area's shapes which used to have indices higher than `shape_idx` will have their index decreased by one.

> method area_set_area_monitor_callback(area: RID, callback: Callable) -> void

Sets the area's area monitor callback. This callback will be called when any other (shape of an) area enters or exits (a shape of) the given area, and must take the following five parameters:
1. an integer `status`: either `AREA_BODY_ADDED` or `AREA_BODY_REMOVED` depending on whether the other area's shape entered or exited the area,
2. an `RID` `area_rid`: the `RID` of the other area that entered or exited the area,
3. an integer `instance_id`: the `ObjectID` attached to the other area,
4. an integer `area_shape_idx`: the index of the shape of the other area that entered or exited the area,
5. an integer `self_shape_idx`: the index of the shape of the area where the other area entered or exited.
By counting (or keeping track of) the shapes that enter and exit, it can be determined if an area (with all its shapes) is entering for the first time or exiting for the last time.

> method area_set_collision_layer(area: RID, layer: int) -> void

Assigns the area to one or many physics layers, via a bitmask.

> method area_set_collision_mask(area: RID, mask: int) -> void

Sets which physics layers the area will monitor, via a bitmask.

2. an `RID` `body_rid`: the `RID` of the body that entered or exited the area,
3. an integer `instance_id`: the `ObjectID` attached to the body,
4. an integer `body_shape_idx`: the index of the shape of the body that entered or exited the area,
5. an integer `self_shape_idx`: the index of the shape of the area where the body entered or exited.
By counting (or keeping track of) the shapes that enter and exit, it can be determined if a body (with all its shapes) is entering for the first time or exiting for the last time.

> method area_set_monitorable(area: RID, monitorable: bool) -> void

Sets whether the area is monitorable or not. If `monitorable` is `true`, the area monitoring callback of other areas will be called when this area enters or exits them.

Sets the value of the given area parameter.

> method area_set_shape(area: RID, shape_idx: int, shape: RID) -> void

> method area_set_shape_disabled(area: RID, shape_idx: int, disabled: bool) -> void

Sets the disabled property of the area's shape with the given index. If `disabled` is `true`, then the shape will not detect any other shapes entering or exiting it.

Sets the local transform matrix of the area's shape with the given index.

> method area_set_space(area: RID, space: RID) -> void

Adds the area to the given space, after removing the area from the previously assigned space (if any).
**Note:** To remove an area from a space without immediately adding it back elsewhere, use `PhysicsServer2D.area_set_space(area, RID())`.

> method area_set_transform(area: RID, transform: Transform2D) -> void

Sets the transform matrix of the area.

> method body_add_collision_exception(body: RID, excepted_body: RID) -> void

Adds `excepted_body` to the body's list of collision exceptions, so that collisions with it are ignored.

> method body_add_constant_central_force(body: RID, force: Vector2) -> void

Adds a constant directional force to the body. The force does not affect rotation. The force remains applied over time until cleared with `PhysicsServer2D.body_set_constant_force(body, Vector2(0, 0))`.
This is equivalent to using `body_add_constant_force` at the body's center of mass.

> method body_add_constant_force(body: RID, force: Vector2, position: Vector2 = Vector2(0, 0)) -> void

Adds a constant positioned force to the body. The force can affect rotation if `position` is different from the body's center of mass. The force remains applied over time until cleared with `PhysicsServer2D.body_set_constant_force(body, Vector2(0, 0))`.
`position` is the offset from the body origin in global coordinates.

> method body_add_constant_torque(body: RID, torque: float) -> void

> method body_apply_central_force(body: RID, force: Vector2) -> void

Applies a directional force to the body, at the body's center of mass. The force does not affect rotation. A force is time dependent and meant to be applied every physics update.
This is equivalent to using `body_apply_force` at the body's center of mass.

> method body_apply_central_impulse(body: RID, impulse: Vector2) -> void

Applies a directional impulse to the body, at the body's center of mass. The impulse does not affect rotation.
An impulse is time-independent! Applying an impulse every frame would result in a framerate-dependent force. For this reason, it should only be used when simulating one-time impacts (use the "_force" functions otherwise).
This is equivalent to using `body_apply_impulse` at the body's center of mass.

> method body_apply_force(body: RID, force: Vector2, position: Vector2 = Vector2(0, 0)) -> void

An impulse is time-independent! Applying an impulse every frame would result in a framerate-dependent force. For this reason, it should only be used when simulating one-time impacts (use the "_force" functions otherwise).
`position` is the offset from the body origin in global coordinates.

> method body_apply_torque(body: RID, torque: float) -> void

Removes all shapes from the body. This does not delete the shapes themselves, so they can continue to be used elsewhere or added back later.

> method body_create() -> RID

Creates a 2D body object in the physics server, and returns the `RID` that identifies it. The default settings for the created area include a collision layer and mask set to `1`, and body mode set to `BODY_MODE_RIGID`.
Use `body_add_shape` to add shapes to it, use `body_set_state` to set its transform, and use `body_set_space` to add the body to a space.

Returns the physics layer or layers the body can collide with, as a bitmask.

> method body_get_collision_priority(body: RID) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the body's collision priority. This is used in the depenetration phase of `body_test_motion`. The higher the priority is, the lower the penetration into the body will be.

> method body_get_constant_force(body: RID) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the body's total constant positional force applied during each physics update.
See `body_add_constant_force` and `body_add_constant_central_force`.

> method body_remove_shape(body: RID, shape_idx: int) -> void

Removes the shape with the given index from the body's array of shapes. The shape itself is not deleted, so it can continue to be used elsewhere or added back later. As a result of this operation, the body's shapes which used to have indices higher than `shape_idx` will have their index decreased by one.

> method body_reset_mass_properties(body: RID) -> void

Restores the default inertia and center of mass of the body based on its shapes. This undoes any custom values previously set using `body_set_param`.

> method body_set_axis_velocity(body: RID, axis_velocity: Vector2) -> void

Modifies the body's linear velocity so that its projection to the axis `axis_velocity.normalized()` is exactly `axis_velocity.length()`. This is useful for jumping behavior.

> method body_set_collision_layer(body: RID, layer: int) -> void

Sets the physics layer or layers the body belongs to, via a bitmask.

> method body_set_collision_mask(body: RID, mask: int) -> void

Sets the physics layer or layers the body can collide with, via a bitmask.

> method body_set_collision_priority(body: RID, priority: float) -> void

Sets the body's collision priority. This is used in the depenetration phase of `body_test_motion`. The higher the priority is, the lower the penetration into the body will be.

> method body_set_constant_force(body: RID, force: Vector2) -> void

Sets the body's total constant positional force applied during each physics update.
See `body_add_constant_force` and `body_add_constant_central_force`.

> method body_set_constant_torque(body: RID, torque: float) -> void

Sets the body's total constant rotational force applied during each physics update.
See `body_add_constant_torque`.

> method body_set_continuous_collision_detection_mode(body: RID, mode: CCDMode) -> void

Sets the continuous collision detection mode.
Continuous collision detection tries to predict where a moving body would collide in between physics updates, instead of moving it and correcting its movement if it collided.

> method body_set_force_integration_callback(body: RID, callable: Callable, userdata: Variant = null) -> void

Sets the body's custom force integration callback function to `callable`. Use an empty `Callable` (`Callable()`) to clear the custom callback.
The function `callable` will be called every physics tick, before the standard force integration (see `body_set_omit_force_integration`). It can be used for example to update the body's linear and angular velocity based on contact with other bodies.
If `userdata` is not `null`, the function `callable` must take the following two parameters:
1. `state`: a `PhysicsDirectBodyState2D` used to retrieve and modify the body's state,
2. `userdata`: a `Variant`; its value will be the `userdata` passed into this method.
If `userdata` is `null`, then `callable` must take only the `state` parameter.

> method body_set_max_contacts_reported(body: RID, amount: int) -> void

Sets the maximum number of contacts that the body can report. If `amount` is greater than zero, then the body will keep track of at most this many contacts with other bodies.

> method body_set_mode(body: RID, mode: BodyMode) -> void

Sets the body's mode.

> method body_set_omit_force_integration(body: RID, enable: bool) -> void

Sets whether the body omits the standard force integration. If `enable` is `true`, the body will not automatically use applied forces, torques, and damping to update the body's linear and angular velocity. In this case, `body_set_force_integration_callback` can be used to manually update the linear and angular velocity instead.
This method is called when the property `RigidBody2D.custom_integrator` is set.

> method body_set_param(body: RID, param: BodyParameter, value: Variant) -> void

Sets the value of the given body parameter.

> method body_set_shape(body: RID, shape_idx: int, shape: RID) -> void

Replaces the body's shape at the given index by another shape, while not affecting the `transform`, `disabled`, and one-way collision properties at the same index.

> method body_set_shape_as_one_way_collision(body: RID, shape_idx: int, enable: bool, margin: float, direction: Vector2 = Vector2(0, 1)) -> void

Sets the one-way collision properties of the body's shape with the given index. If `enable` is `true`, the one-way collision direction given by `direction` in the shape's local space (that is `body_get_shape_transform(body, shape_idx).basis_xform(direction).normalized()` in the body's local space) will be used to ignore collisions with the shape in the opposite direction, and to ensure depenetration of kinematic bodies happens in this direction.

> method body_set_shape_disabled(body: RID, shape_idx: int, disabled: bool) -> void

Sets the disabled property of the body's shape with the given index. If `disabled` is `true`, then the shape will be ignored in all collision detection.

> method body_set_shape_transform(body: RID, shape_idx: int, transform: Transform2D) -> void

Sets the local transform matrix of the body's shape with the given index.

> method body_set_space(body: RID, space: RID) -> void

Adds the body to the given space, after removing the body from the previously assigned space (if any). If the body's mode is set to `BODY_MODE_RIGID`, then adding the body to a space will have the following additional effects:
- If the parameter `BODY_PARAM_CENTER_OF_MASS` has never been set explicitly, then the value of that parameter will be recalculated based on the body's shapes.
- If the parameter `BODY_PARAM_INERTIA` is set to a value `<= 0.0`, then the value of that parameter will be recalculated based on the body's shapes, mass, and center of mass.
**Note:** To remove a body from a space without immediately adding it back elsewhere, use `PhysicsServer2D.body_set_space(body, RID())`.

> method body_set_state(body: RID, state: BodyState, value: Variant) -> void

Sets the value of a body's state.
**Note:** The state change doesn't take effect immediately. The state will change on the next physics frame.

> method body_set_state_sync_callback(body: RID, callable: Callable) -> void

Sets the body's state synchronization callback function to `callable`. Use an empty `Callable` (`Callable()`) to clear the callback.
The function `callable` will be called every physics frame, assuming that the body was active during the previous physics tick, and can be used to fetch the latest state from the physics server.
The function `callable` must take the following parameters:
1. `state`: a `PhysicsDirectBodyState2D`, used to retrieve the body's state.

> method body_test_motion(body: RID, parameters: PhysicsTestMotionParameters2D, result: PhysicsTestMotionResult2D = null) -> bool

Returns `true` if a collision would result from moving the body along a motion vector from a given point in space. See `PhysicsTestMotionParameters2D` for the available motion parameters. Optionally a `PhysicsTestMotionResult2D` object can be passed, which will be used to store the information about the resulting collision.

> method free_rid(rid: RID) -> void

Destroys any of the objects created by PhysicsServer2D. If the `RID` passed is not one of the objects that can be created by PhysicsServer2D, an error will be printed to the console.

> method get_process_info(process_info: ProcessInfo) -> int

Returns the value of a physics engine state specified by `process_info`.

Makes the joint a damped spring joint, attached at the point `anchor_a` (given in global coordinates) on the body `body_a` and at the point `anchor_b` (given in global coordinates) on the body `body_b`. To set the parameters which are specific to the damped spring, see `damped_spring_joint_set_param`.

> method joint_make_groove(joint: RID, groove1_a: Vector2, groove2_a: Vector2, anchor_b: Vector2, body_a: RID = RID(), body_b: RID = RID()) -> void

If `body_b` is an empty `RID`, then `body_a` is pinned to the point `anchor` (given in global coordinates); otherwise, `body_a` is pinned to `body_b` at the point `anchor` (given in global coordinates). To set the parameters which are specific to the pin joint, see `pin_joint_set_param`.

Sets the shape data that defines the configuration of the shape. The `data` to be passed depends on the shape's type (see `shape_get_type`):
- `SHAPE_WORLD_BOUNDARY`: an array of length two containing a `Vector2` `normal` direction and a `float` distance `d`,
- `SHAPE_SEPARATION_RAY`: a dictionary containing the key `length` with a `float` value and the key `slide_on_slope` with a `bool` value,
- `SHAPE_SEGMENT`: a `Rect2` `rect` containing the first point of the segment in `rect.position` and the second point of the segment in `rect.size`,
- `SHAPE_CIRCLE`: a `float` `radius`,
- `SHAPE_RECTANGLE`: a `Vector2` `half_extents`,
- `SHAPE_CAPSULE`: an array of length two (or a `Vector2`) containing a `float` `height` and a `float` `radius`,
- `SHAPE_CONVEX_POLYGON`: either a `PackedVector2Array` of points defining a convex polygon in counterclockwise order (the clockwise outward normal of each segment formed by consecutive points is calculated internally), or a `PackedFloat32Array` of length divisible by four so that every 4-tuple of `float`s contains the coordinates of a point followed by the coordinates of the clockwise outward normal vector to the segment between the current point and the next point,
- `SHAPE_CONCAVE_POLYGON`: a `PackedVector2Array` of length divisible by two (each pair of points forms one segment).
**Warning:** In the case of `SHAPE_CONVEX_POLYGON`, this method does not check if the points supplied actually form a convex polygon (unlike the `CollisionPolygon2D.polygon` property).

The value of the first parameter and area callback function receives, when an object exits one of its shapes.

> enum AreaParameter

> enum_value AreaParameter.AREA_PARAM_GRAVITY_OVERRIDE_MODE = 0

Constant to set/get gravity override mode in an area. See `AreaSpaceOverrideMode` for possible values. The default value of this parameter is `AREA_SPACE_OVERRIDE_DISABLED`.

> enum_value AreaParameter.AREA_PARAM_GRAVITY = 1

Constant to set/get gravity strength in an area. The default value of this parameter is `9.80665`.

> enum_value AreaParameter.AREA_PARAM_GRAVITY_VECTOR = 2

> enum_value AreaParameter.AREA_PARAM_GRAVITY_POINT_UNIT_DISTANCE = 4

The gravity will have falloff according to the inverse square law, so in the example, at 200 pixels from the center the gravity will be 1.0 px/s² (twice the distance, 1/4th the gravity), at 50 pixels it will be 16.0 px/s² (half the distance, 4x the gravity), and so on.
The above is true only when the unit distance is a positive number. When the unit distance is set to 0.0, the gravity will be constant regardless of distance. The default value of this parameter is `0.0`.
