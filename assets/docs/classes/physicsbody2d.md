## Brief

Abstract base class for 2D game objects affected by physics.

## Description

`PhysicsBody2D` is an abstract base class for 2D game objects affected by physics. All 2D physics bodies inherit from it.

## Properties

> property input_pickable : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_pickable ; getter=is_pickable ; overrides=CollisionObject2D

## Methods

> method add_collision_exception_with(body: Node) -> void

Adds a body to the list of bodies that this body can't collide with.

> method get_collision_exceptions() -> Array[PhysicsBody2D]

Returns an array of nodes that were added as collision exceptions for this body.

> method get_gravity() -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the gravity vector computed from all sources that can affect the body, including all gravity overrides from `Area2D` nodes and the global world gravity.

> method move_and_collide(motion: Vector2, test_only: bool = false, safe_margin: float = 0.08, recovery_as_collision: bool = false) -> KinematicCollision2D

Moves the body along the vector `motion`. In order to be frame rate independent in `Node._physics_process` or `Node._process`, `motion` should be computed using `delta`.
Returns a `KinematicCollision2D`, which contains information about the collision when stopped, or when touching another body along the motion.
If `test_only` is `true`, the body does not move but the would-be collision information is given.
`safe_margin` is the extra margin used for collision recovery (see `CharacterBody2D.safe_margin` for more details).
If `recovery_as_collision` is `true`, any depenetration from the recovery phase is also reported as a collision; this is used e.g. by `CharacterBody2D` for improving floor detection during floor snapping.

> method remove_collision_exception_with(body: Node) -> void

Removes a body from the list of bodies that this body can't collide with.

> method test_move(from: Transform2D, motion: Vector2, collision: KinematicCollision2D = null, safe_margin: float = 0.08, recovery_as_collision: bool = false) -> bool

Checks for collisions without moving the body. In order to be frame rate independent in `Node._physics_process` or `Node._process`, `motion` should be computed using `delta`.
Virtually sets the node's position, scale and rotation to that of the given `Transform2D`, then tries to move the body along the vector `motion`. Returns `true` if a collision would stop the body from moving along the whole path.
`collision` is an optional object of type `KinematicCollision2D`, which contains additional information about the collision when stopped, or when touching another body along the motion.
`safe_margin` is the extra margin used for collision recovery (see `CharacterBody2D.safe_margin` for more details).
If `recovery_as_collision` is `true`, any depenetration from the recovery phase is also reported as a collision; this is useful for checking whether the body would *touch* any other bodies.
