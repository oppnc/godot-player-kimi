# AudioStreamPlaybackPolyphonic

> class AudioStreamPlaybackPolyphonic
> inherits AudioStreamPlaybackPolyphonic AudioStreamPlayback

## Brief

Playback instance for `AudioStreamPolyphonic`.

## Description

Playback instance for `AudioStreamPolyphonic`. After setting the `stream` property of `AudioStreamPlayer`, `AudioStreamPlayer2D`, or `AudioStreamPlayer3D`, the playback instance can be obtained by calling `AudioStreamPlayer.get_stream_playback`, `AudioStreamPlayer2D.get_stream_playback` or `AudioStreamPlayer3D.get_stream_playback` methods.

## Methods

> method is_stream_playing(stream: int) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the stream associated with the given integer ID is still playing. Check `play_stream` for information on when this ID becomes invalid.

> method play_stream(stream: AudioStream, from_offset: float = 0, volume_db: float = 0, pitch_scale: float = 1.0, playback_type: AudioServer.PlaybackType = 0, bus: StringName = &"Master") -> int

Play an `AudioStream` at a given offset, volume, pitch scale, playback type, and bus. Playback starts immediately.
The return value is a unique integer ID that is associated to this playback stream and which can be used to control it.
This ID becomes invalid when the stream ends (if it does not loop), when the `AudioStreamPlaybackPolyphonic` is stopped, or when `stop_stream` is called.
This function returns `INVALID_ID` if the amount of streams currently playing equals `AudioStreamPolyphonic.polyphony`. If you need a higher amount of maximum polyphony, raise this value.

> method set_stream_pitch_scale(stream: int, pitch_scale: float) -> void

Change the stream pitch scale. The `stream` argument is an integer ID returned by `play_stream`.

> method set_stream_volume(stream: int, volume_db: float) -> void

Change the stream volume (in db). The `stream` argument is an integer ID returned by `play_stream`.

> method stop_stream(stream: int) -> void

Stop a stream. The `stream` argument is an integer ID returned by `play_stream`, which becomes invalid after calling this function.

## Constants

> constant INVALID_ID = -1

Returned by `play_stream` in case it could not allocate a stream for playback.
