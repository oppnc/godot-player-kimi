## Brief

An implementation of A* for finding the shortest path between two vertices on a connected graph in 3D space.

## Description

A* (A star) is a computer algorithm used in pathfinding and graph traversal, the process of plotting short paths among vertices (points), passing through a given set of edges (segments). It enjoys widespread use due to its performance and accuracy. Godot's A* implementation uses points in 3D space and Euclidean distances by default.
You must add points manually with `add_point` and create segments manually with `connect_points`. Once done, you can test if there is a path between two points with the `are_points_connected` function, get a path containing indices by `get_id_path`, or one containing actual coordinates with `get_point_path`.
It is also possible to use non-Euclidean distances. To do so, create a script that extends `AStar3D` and override the methods `_compute_cost` and `_estimate_cost`. Both should take two point IDs and return the distance between the corresponding points.
**Example:** Use Manhattan distance instead of Euclidean distance:

```gdscript
        class_name MyAStar3D
        extends AStar3D

        func _compute_cost(u, v):
            var u_pos = get_point_position(u)
            var v_pos = get_point_position(v)
            return abs(u_pos.x - v_pos.x) + abs(u_pos.y - v_pos.y) + abs(u_pos.z - v_pos.z)

        func _estimate_cost(u, v):
            var u_pos = get_point_position(u)
            var v_pos = get_point_position(v)
            return abs(u_pos.x - v_pos.x) + abs(u_pos.y - v_pos.y) + abs(u_pos.z - v_pos.z)

```

```csharp
        using Godot;

        [GlobalClass]
        public partial class MyAStar3D : AStar3D
        {
            public override float _ComputeCost(long fromId, long toId)
            {
                Vector3 fromPoint = GetPointPosition(fromId);
                Vector3 toPoint = GetPointPosition(toId);

                return Mathf.Abs(fromPoint.X - toPoint.X) + Mathf.Abs(fromPoint.Y - toPoint.Y) + Mathf.Abs(fromPoint.Z - toPoint.Z);
            }

            public override float _EstimateCost(long fromId, long toId)
            {
                Vector3 fromPoint = GetPointPosition(fromId);
                Vector3 toPoint = GetPointPosition(toId);
                return Mathf.Abs(fromPoint.X - toPoint.X) + Mathf.Abs(fromPoint.Y - toPoint.Y) + Mathf.Abs(fromPoint.Z - toPoint.Z);
            }
        }

```

`_estimate_cost` should return a lower bound of the distance, i.e. `_estimate_cost(u, v) <= _compute_cost(u, v)`. This serves as a hint to the algorithm because the custom `_compute_cost` might be computation-heavy. If this is not the case, make `_estimate_cost` return the same value as `_compute_cost` to provide the algorithm with the most accurate information.
If the default `_estimate_cost` and `_compute_cost` methods are used, or if the supplied `_estimate_cost` method returns a lower bound of the cost, then the paths returned by A* will be the lowest-cost paths. Here, the cost of a path equals the sum of the `_compute_cost` results of all segments in the path multiplied by the `weight_scale`s of the endpoints of the respective segments. If the default methods are used and the `weight_scale`s of all points are set to `1.0`, then this equals the sum of Euclidean distances of all segments in the path.

## Properties

> property neighbor_filter_enabled : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_neighbor_filter_enabled ; getter=is_neighbor_filter_enabled

If `true` enables the filtering of neighbors via `_filter_neighbor`.

## Methods

> method _compute_cost(from_id: int, to_id: int) -> float ; qualifiers=virtual const

Called when computing the cost between two connected points.
Note that this function is hidden in the default `AStar3D` class.

> method _estimate_cost(from_id: int, end_id: int) -> float ; qualifiers=virtual const

Called when estimating the cost between a point and the path's ending point.
Note that this function is hidden in the default `AStar3D` class.

> method _filter_neighbor(from_id: int, neighbor_id: int) -> bool ; qualifiers=virtual const

Called when neighboring point enters processing and if `neighbor_filter_enabled` is `true`. If `true` is returned the point will not be processed.
Note that this function is hidden in the default `AStar3D` class.

> method add_point(id: int, position: Vector3, weight_scale: float = 1.0) -> void

Adds a new point at the given position with the given identifier. The `id` must be 0 or larger, and the `weight_scale` must be 0.0 or greater.
The `weight_scale` is multiplied by the result of `_compute_cost` when determining the overall cost of traveling across a segment from a neighboring point to this point. Thus, all else being equal, the algorithm prefers points with lower `weight_scale`s to form a path.

```gdscript
                var astar = AStar3D.new()
                astar.add_point(1, Vector3(1, 0, 0), 4) # Adds the point (1, 0, 0) with weight_scale 4 and id 1

```

```csharp
                var astar = new AStar3D();
                astar.AddPoint(1, new Vector3(1, 0, 0), 4); // Adds the point (1, 0, 0) with weight_scale 4 and id 1

```

If there already exists a point for the given `id`, its position and weight scale are updated to the given values.

> method are_points_connected(id: int, to_id: int, bidirectional: bool = true) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns whether the two given points are directly connected by a segment. If `bidirectional` is `false`, returns whether movement from `id` to `to_id` is possible through this segment.

> method clear() -> void

Clears all the points and segments.

> method connect_points(id: int, to_id: int, bidirectional: bool = true) -> void

Creates a segment between the given points. If `bidirectional` is `false`, only movement from `id` to `to_id` is allowed, not the reverse direction.

```gdscript
                var astar = AStar3D.new()
                astar.add_point(1, Vector3(1, 1, 0))
                astar.add_point(2, Vector3(0, 5, 0))
                astar.connect_points(1, 2, false)

```

```csharp
                var astar = new AStar3D();
                astar.AddPoint(1, new Vector3(1, 1, 0));
                astar.AddPoint(2, new Vector3(0, 5, 0));
                astar.ConnectPoints(1, 2, false);

```

> method disconnect_points(id: int, to_id: int, bidirectional: bool = true) -> void

Deletes the segment between the given points. If `bidirectional` is `false`, only movement from `id` to `to_id` is prevented, and a unidirectional segment possibly remains.

> method get_available_point_id() -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the next available point ID with no point associated to it.

> method get_closest_point(to_position: Vector3, include_disabled: bool = false) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the ID of the closest point to `to_position`, optionally taking disabled points into account. Returns `-1` if there are no points in the points pool.
**Note:** If several points are the closest to `to_position`, the one with the smallest ID will be returned, ensuring a deterministic result.

> method get_closest_position_in_segment(to_position: Vector3) -> Vector3 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the closest position to `to_position` that resides inside a segment between two connected points.

```gdscript
                var astar = AStar3D.new()
                astar.add_point(1, Vector3(0, 0, 0))
                astar.add_point(2, Vector3(0, 5, 0))
                astar.connect_points(1, 2)
                var res = astar.get_closest_position_in_segment(Vector3(3, 3, 0)) # Returns (0, 3, 0)

```

```csharp
                var astar = new AStar3D();
                astar.AddPoint(1, new Vector3(0, 0, 0));
                astar.AddPoint(2, new Vector3(0, 5, 0));
                astar.ConnectPoints(1, 2);
                Vector3 res = astar.GetClosestPositionInSegment(new Vector3(3, 3, 0)); // Returns (0, 3, 0)

```

The result is in the segment that goes from `y = 0` to `y = 5`. It's the closest position in the segment to the given point.

> method get_id_path(from_id: int, to_id: int, allow_partial_path: bool = false) -> PackedInt64Array

Returns an array with the IDs of the points that form the path found by AStar3D between the given points. The array is ordered from the starting point to the ending point of the path.
If `from_id` point is disabled, returns an empty array (even if `from_id == to_id`).
If `from_id` point is not disabled, there is no valid path to the target, and `allow_partial_path` is `true`, returns a path to the point closest to the target that can be reached.
**Note:** When `allow_partial_path` is `true` and `to_id` is disabled the search may take an unusually long time to finish.

```gdscript
                var astar = AStar3D.new()
                astar.add_point(1, Vector3(0, 0, 0))
                astar.add_point(2, Vector3(0, 1, 0), 1) # Default weight is 1
                astar.add_point(3, Vector3(1, 1, 0))
                astar.add_point(4, Vector3(2, 0, 0))

                astar.connect_points(1, 2, false)
                astar.connect_points(2, 3, false)
                astar.connect_points(4, 3, false)
                astar.connect_points(1, 4, false)

                var res = astar.get_id_path(1, 3) # Returns [1, 2, 3]

```

```csharp
                var astar = new AStar3D();
                astar.AddPoint(1, new Vector3(0, 0, 0));
                astar.AddPoint(2, new Vector3(0, 1, 0), 1); // Default weight is 1
                astar.AddPoint(3, new Vector3(1, 1, 0));
                astar.AddPoint(4, new Vector3(2, 0, 0));
                astar.ConnectPoints(1, 2, false);
                astar.ConnectPoints(2, 3, false);
                astar.ConnectPoints(4, 3, false);
                astar.ConnectPoints(1, 4, false);
                long[] res = astar.GetIdPath(1, 3); // Returns [1, 2, 3]

```

If you change the 2nd point's weight to 3, then the result will be `[1, 4, 3]` instead, because now even though the distance is longer, it's "easier" to get through point 4 than through point 2.

> method get_point_capacity() -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the capacity of the structure backing the points, useful in conjunction with `reserve_space`.

> method get_point_connections(id: int) -> PackedInt64Array

Returns an array with the IDs of the points that form the connection with the given point.

```gdscript
                var astar = AStar3D.new()
                astar.add_point(1, Vector3(0, 0, 0))
                astar.add_point(2, Vector3(0, 1, 0))
                astar.add_point(3, Vector3(1, 1, 0))
                astar.add_point(4, Vector3(2, 0, 0))

                astar.connect_points(1, 2, true)
                astar.connect_points(1, 3, true)

                var neighbors = astar.get_point_connections(1) # Returns [2, 3]

```

```csharp
                var astar = new AStar3D();
                astar.AddPoint(1, new Vector3(0, 0, 0));
                astar.AddPoint(2, new Vector3(0, 1, 0));
                astar.AddPoint(3, new Vector3(1, 1, 0));
                astar.AddPoint(4, new Vector3(2, 0, 0));
                astar.ConnectPoints(1, 2, true);
                astar.ConnectPoints(1, 3, true);

                long[] neighbors = astar.GetPointConnections(1); // Returns [2, 3]

```

> method get_point_count() -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the number of points currently in the points pool.

> method get_point_ids() -> PackedInt64Array

Returns an array of all point IDs.

> method get_point_path(from_id: int, to_id: int, allow_partial_path: bool = false) -> PackedVector3Array

Returns an array with the points that are in the path found by AStar3D between the given points. The array is ordered from the starting point to the ending point of the path.
If `from_id` point is disabled, returns an empty array (even if `from_id == to_id`).
If `from_id` point is not disabled, there is no valid path to the target, and `allow_partial_path` is `true`, returns a path to the point closest to the target that can be reached.
**Note:** This method is not thread-safe; it can only be used from a single `Thread` at a given time. Consider using `Mutex` to ensure exclusive access to one thread to avoid race conditions.
Additionally, when `allow_partial_path` is `true` and `to_id` is disabled the search may take an unusually long time to finish.

> method get_point_position(id: int) -> Vector3 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the position of the point associated with the given `id`.

> method get_point_weight_scale(id: int) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the weight scale of the point associated with the given `id`.

> method has_point(id: int) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns whether a point associated with the given `id` exists.

> method is_point_disabled(id: int) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns whether a point is disabled or not for pathfinding. By default, all points are enabled.

> method remove_point(id: int) -> void

Removes the point associated with the given `id` from the points pool.

> method reserve_space(num_nodes: int) -> void

Reserves space internally for `num_nodes` points. Useful if you're adding a known large number of points at once, such as points on a grid.

> method set_point_disabled(id: int, disabled: bool = true) -> void

Disables or enables the specified point for pathfinding. Useful for making a temporary obstacle.

> method set_point_position(id: int, position: Vector3) -> void

Sets the `position` for the point with the given `id`.

> method set_point_weight_scale(id: int, weight_scale: float) -> void

Sets the `weight_scale` for the point with the given `id`. The `weight_scale` is multiplied by the result of `_compute_cost` when determining the overall cost of traveling across a segment from a neighboring point to this point.
