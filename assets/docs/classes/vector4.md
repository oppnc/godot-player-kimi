# Vector4

> class Vector4

## Brief

A 4D vector using floating-point coordinates.

## Description

A 4-element structure that can be used to represent 4D coordinates or any other quadruplet of numeric values.
It uses floating-point coordinates. By default, these floating-point values use 32-bit precision, unlike `float` which is always 64-bit. If double precision is needed, compile the engine with the option `precision=double`.
See `Vector4i` for its integer counterpart.
**Note:** In a boolean context, a Vector4 will evaluate to `false` if it's equal to `Vector4(0, 0, 0, 0)`. Otherwise, a Vector4 will always evaluate to `true`.

## Properties

> property w : float ; default=0.0

The vector's W component. Also accessible by using the index position `[3]`.

> property x : float ; default=0.0

The vector's X component. Also accessible by using the index position `[0]`.

> property y : float ; default=0.0

The vector's Y component. Also accessible by using the index position `[1]`.

> property z : float ; default=0.0

The vector's Z component. Also accessible by using the index position `[2]`.

## Methods

> method abs() -> Vector4 ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new vector with all components in absolute values (i.e. positive).

> method ceil() -> Vector4 ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new vector with all components rounded up (towards positive infinity).

> method clamp(min: Vector4, max: Vector4) -> Vector4 ; qualifiers=const

> method cubic_interpolate(b: Vector4, pre_a: Vector4, post_b: Vector4, weight: float) -> Vector4 ; qualifiers=const

Performs a cubic interpolation between this vector and `b` using `pre_a` and `post_b` as handles, and returns the result at position `weight`. `weight` is on the range of 0.0 to 1.0, representing the amount of interpolation.

> method cubic_interpolate_in_time(b: Vector4, pre_a: Vector4, post_b: Vector4, weight: float, b_t: float, pre_a_t: float, post_b_t: float) -> Vector4 ; qualifiers=const

Performs a cubic interpolation between this vector and `b` using `pre_a` and `post_b` as handles, and returns the result at position `weight`. `weight` is on the range of 0.0 to 1.0, representing the amount of interpolation.
It can perform smoother interpolation than `cubic_interpolate` by the time values.

> method direction_to(to: Vector4) -> Vector4 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the normalized vector pointing from this vector to `to`. This is equivalent to using `(b - a).normalized()`.

> method distance_squared_to(to: Vector4) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the squared [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) between this vector and `to`.
This method runs faster than `distance_to`, so prefer it if you need to compare vectors or need the squared distance for some formula.

> method distance_to(to: Vector4) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) between this vector and `to`.

> method dot(with: Vector4) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the dot product of this vector and `with`.

> method floor() -> Vector4 ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new vector with all components rounded down (towards negative infinity).

> method inverse() -> Vector4 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the inverse of the vector. This is the same as `Vector4(1.0 / v.x, 1.0 / v.y, 1.0 / v.z, 1.0 / v.w)`.

> method is_equal_approx(to: Vector4) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this vector and `to` are approximately equal, by running `@GlobalScope.is_equal_approx` on each component.

> method is_finite() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this vector is finite, by calling `@GlobalScope.is_finite` on each component.

> method is_normalized() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the vector is normalized, i.e. its length is approximately equal to 1.

> method is_zero_approx() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this vector's values are approximately zero, by running `@GlobalScope.is_zero_approx` on each component.
This method is faster than using `is_equal_approx` with one value as a zero vector.

> method length() -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the length (magnitude) of this vector.

> method length_squared() -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the squared length (squared magnitude) of this vector.
This method runs faster than `length`, so prefer it if you need to compare vectors or need the squared distance for some formula.

> method lerp(to: Vector4, weight: float) -> Vector4 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the result of the linear interpolation between this vector and `to` by amount `weight`. `weight` is on the range of `0.0` to `1.0`, representing the amount of interpolation.

> method minf(with: float) -> Vector4 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the component-wise minimum of this and `with`, equivalent to `Vector4(minf(x, with), minf(y, with), minf(z, with), minf(w, with))`.

> method normalized() -> Vector4 ; qualifiers=const

**Note:** This function may return incorrect values if the input vector length is near zero.

> method posmod(mod: float) -> Vector4 ; qualifiers=const

## Operators

> operator !=(right: Vector4) -> bool

Returns `true` if the vectors are not equal.
**Note:** Due to floating-point precision errors, consider using `is_equal_approx` instead, which is more reliable.
**Note:** Vectors with `@GDScript.NAN` elements don't behave the same as other vectors. Therefore, the results from this operator may not be accurate if NaNs are included.

> operator <(right: Vector4) -> bool

Compares two `Vector4` vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is less than the X value of the `right` vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors, Z values of the two vectors, and then with the W values. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.
**Note:** Vectors with `@GDScript.NAN` elements don't behave the same as other vectors. Therefore, the results from this operator may not be accurate if NaNs are included.

> operator <=(right: Vector4) -> bool

> operator [](index: int) -> float

Access vector components using their `index`. `v[0]` is equivalent to `v.x`, `v[1]` is equivalent to `v.y`, `v[2]` is equivalent to `v.z`, and `v[3]` is equivalent to `v.w`.

> operator unary+() -> Vector4

Returns the same value as if the `+` was not there. Unary `+` does nothing, but sometimes it can make your code more readable.

> operator unary-() -> Vector4

Returns the negative value of the `Vector4`. This is the same as writing `Vector4(-v.x, -v.y, -v.z, -v.w)`. This operation flips the direction of the vector while keeping the same magnitude. With floats, the number zero can be either positive or negative.
