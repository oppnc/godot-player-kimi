# NavigationServer3D

> class NavigationServer3D ; experimental=This class may be changed or removed in future versions.
> inherits NavigationServer3D Object

## Brief

A server interface for low-level 3D navigation access.

## Description

NavigationServer3D is the server that handles navigation maps, regions and agents. It does not handle A* navigation from `AStar3D`.
Maps are divided into regions, which are composed of navigation meshes. Together, they define the navigable areas in the 3D world.
**Note:** Most `NavigationServer3D` changes take effect after the next physics frame and not immediately. This includes all changes made to maps, regions or agents by navigation-related nodes in the scene tree or made through scripts.
For two regions to be connected to each other, they must share a similar edge. An edge is considered connected to another if both of its two vertices are at a distance less than `edge_connection_margin` to the respective other edge's vertex.
You may assign navigation layers to regions with `NavigationServer3D.region_set_navigation_layers`, which then can be checked upon when requesting a path with `NavigationServer3D.map_get_path`. This can be used to allow or deny certain areas for some objects.
To use the collision avoidance system, you may use agents. You can set an agent's target velocity, then the servers will emit a callback with a modified velocity.
**Note:** The collision avoidance system ignores regions. Using the modified velocity directly may move an agent outside of the traversable area. This is a limitation of the collision avoidance system, any more complex situation may require the use of the physics engine.
This server keeps tracks of any call and executes them during the sync phase. This means that you can request any change to the map, using any thread, without worrying.

## Methods

> method agent_create() -> RID

Creates the agent.

> method agent_get_avoidance_enabled(agent: RID) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the provided `agent` has avoidance enabled.

Returns the position of the specified `agent` in world space.

> method agent_get_radius(agent: RID) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the radius of the specified `agent`.

> method agent_get_time_horizon_agents(agent: RID) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the minimal amount of time for which the specified `agent`'s velocities that are computed by the simulation are safe with respect to other agents.

> method agent_get_time_horizon_obstacles(agent: RID) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the minimal amount of time for which the specified `agent`'s velocities that are computed by the simulation are safe with respect to static avoidance obstacles.

> method agent_get_use_3d_avoidance(agent: RID) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the provided `agent` uses avoidance in 3D space Vector3(x,y,z) instead of horizontal 2D Vector2(x,y) / Vector3(x,0.0,z).

> method agent_get_velocity(agent: RID) -> Vector3 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the velocity of the specified `agent`.

> method agent_has_avoidance_callback(agent: RID) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Return `true` if the specified `agent` has an avoidance callback.

> method agent_is_map_changed(agent: RID) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the map got changed the previous frame.

> method agent_set_avoidance_callback(agent: RID, callback: Callable) -> void

Sets the callback `Callable` that gets called after each avoidance processing step for the `agent`. The calculated `safe_velocity` will be dispatched with a signal to the object just before the physics calculations.
**Note:** Created callbacks are always processed independently of the SceneTree state as long as the agent is on a navigation map and not freed. To disable the dispatch of a callback from an agent use `agent_set_avoidance_callback` again with an empty `Callable`.

> method agent_set_avoidance_enabled(agent: RID, enabled: bool) -> void

If `enabled` is `true`, the provided `agent` calculates avoidance.

> method agent_set_avoidance_layers(agent: RID, layers: int) -> void

Set the agent's `avoidance_layers` bitmask.

> method agent_set_avoidance_mask(agent: RID, mask: int) -> void

Set the agent's `avoidance_mask` bitmask.

> method agent_set_avoidance_priority(agent: RID, priority: float) -> void

Set the agent's `avoidance_priority` with a `priority` between 0.0 (lowest priority) to 1.0 (highest priority).
The specified `agent` does not adjust the velocity for other agents that would match the `avoidance_mask` but have a lower `avoidance_priority`. This in turn makes the other agents with lower priority adjust their velocities even more to avoid collision with this agent.

> method agent_set_height(agent: RID, height: float) -> void

Updates the provided `agent` `height`.

> method agent_set_map(agent: RID, map: RID) -> void

Puts the agent in the map.

> method agent_set_max_neighbors(agent: RID, count: int) -> void

Sets the maximum number of other agents the agent takes into account in the navigation. The larger this number, the longer the running time of the simulation. If the number is too low, the simulation will not be safe.

> method agent_set_max_speed(agent: RID, max_speed: float) -> void

Sets the maximum speed of the agent. Must be positive.

> method agent_set_neighbor_distance(agent: RID, distance: float) -> void

Sets the maximum distance to other agents this agent takes into account in the navigation. The larger this number, the longer the running time of the simulation. If the number is too low, the simulation will not be safe.

> method agent_set_paused(agent: RID, paused: bool) -> void

If `paused` is `true` the specified `agent` will not be processed. For example, it will not calculate avoidance velocities or receive avoidance callbacks.

> method agent_set_position(agent: RID, position: Vector3) -> void

Sets the position of the agent in world space.

> method agent_set_radius(agent: RID, radius: float) -> void

Sets the radius of the agent.

> method agent_set_time_horizon_agents(agent: RID, time_horizon: float) -> void

The minimal amount of time for which the agent's velocities that are computed by the simulation are safe with respect to other agents. The larger this number, the sooner this agent will respond to the presence of other agents, but the less freedom this agent has in choosing its velocities. A too high value will slow down agents movement considerably. Must be positive.

> method agent_set_time_horizon_obstacles(agent: RID, time_horizon: float) -> void

The minimal amount of time for which the agent's velocities that are computed by the simulation are safe with respect to static avoidance obstacles. The larger this number, the sooner this agent will respond to the presence of static avoidance obstacles, but the less freedom this agent has in choosing its velocities. A too high value will slow down agents movement considerably. Must be positive.

> method agent_set_use_3d_avoidance(agent: RID, enabled: bool) -> void

Sets if the agent uses the 2D avoidance or the 3D avoidance while avoidance is enabled.
If `true` the agent calculates avoidance velocities in 3D for the xyz-axis, e.g. for games that take place in air, underwater or space. The 3D using agent only avoids other 3D avoidance using agent's. The 3D using agent only reacts to radius based avoidance obstacles. The 3D using agent ignores any vertices based obstacles. The 3D using agent only avoids other 3D using agent's.
If `false` the agent calculates avoidance velocities in 2D along the xz-axis ignoring the y-axis. The 2D using agent only avoids other 2D avoidance using agent's. The 2D using agent reacts to radius avoidance obstacles. The 2D using agent reacts to vertices based avoidance obstacles. The 2D using agent only avoids other 2D using agent's. 2D using agents will ignore other 2D using agents or obstacles that are below their current position or above their current position including the agents height in 2D avoidance.

> method agent_set_velocity(agent: RID, velocity: Vector3) -> void

Sets `velocity` as the new wanted velocity for the specified `agent`. The avoidance simulation will try to fulfill this velocity if possible but will modify it to avoid collision with other agent's and obstacles. When an agent is teleported to a new position use `agent_set_velocity_forced` as well to reset the internal simulation velocity.

> method agent_set_velocity_forced(agent: RID, velocity: Vector3) -> void

Replaces the internal velocity in the collision avoidance simulation with `velocity` for the specified `agent`. When an agent is teleported to a new position this function should be used in the same frame. If called frequently this function can get agents stuck.

> method bake_from_source_geometry_data(navigation_mesh: NavigationMesh, source_geometry_data: NavigationMeshSourceGeometryData3D, callback: Callable = Callable()) -> void

Sets the navigation map `RID` for the link.

> method link_set_navigation_layers(link: RID, navigation_layers: int) -> void

Set the links's navigation layers. This allows selecting links from a path request (when using `NavigationServer3D.map_get_path`).

> method link_set_owner_id(link: RID, owner_id: int) -> void

> method link_set_start_position(link: RID, position: Vector3) -> void

Sets the entry position for this `link`.

> method link_set_travel_cost(link: RID, travel_cost: float) -> void

Sets the `travel_cost` for this `link`.

> method map_create() -> RID

Create a new map.

> method map_force_update(map: RID) -> void ; deprecated=This method is no longer supported, as it is incompatible with asynchronous updates. It can only be used in a single-threaded context, at your own risk.

This function immediately forces synchronization of the specified navigation `map` `RID`. By default navigation maps are only synchronized at the end of each physics frame. This function can be used to immediately (re)calculate all the navigation meshes and region connections of the navigation map. This makes it possible to query a navigation path for a changed map immediately and in the same frame (multiple times if needed).
Due to technical restrictions the current NavigationServer command queue will be flushed. This means all already queued update commands for this physics frame will be executed, even those intended for other maps, regions and agents not part of the specified map. The expensive computation of the navigation meshes and region connections of a map will only be done for the specified map. Other maps will receive the normal synchronization at the end of the physics frame. Should the specified map receive changes after the forced update it will update again as well when the other maps receive their update.
Avoidance processing and dispatch of the `safe_velocity` signals is unaffected by this function and continues to happen for all maps and agents at the end of the physics frame.
**Note:** With great power comes great responsibility. This function should only be used by users that really know what they are doing and have a good reason for it. Forcing an immediate update of a navigation map requires locking the NavigationServer and flushing the entire NavigationServer command queue. Not only can this severely impact the performance of a game but it can also introduce bugs if used inappropriately without much foresight.

> method map_get_agents(map: RID) -> Array[RID] ; qualifiers=const

Returns the edge connection margin of the map. This distance is the minimum vertex distance needed to connect two edges from different regions.

> method map_get_iteration_id(map: RID) -> int ; qualifiers=const

> method map_get_random_point(map: RID, navigation_layers: int, uniformly: bool) -> Vector3 ; qualifiers=const

Returns a random position picked from all map region polygons with matching `navigation_layers`.
If `uniformly` is `true`, all map regions, polygons, and faces are weighted by their surface area (slower).

> method parse_source_geometry_data(navigation_mesh: NavigationMesh, source_geometry_data: NavigationMeshSourceGeometryData3D, root_node: Node, callback: Callable = Callable()) -> void

Parses the `SceneTree` for source geometry according to the properties of `navigation_mesh`. Updates the provided `source_geometry_data` resource with the resulting data. The resource can then be used to bake a navigation mesh with `bake_from_source_geometry_data`. After the process is finished the optional `callback` will be called.
**Note:** This function needs to run on the main thread or with a deferred call as the SceneTree is not thread-safe.
**Performance:** While convenient, reading data arrays from `Mesh` resources can affect the frame rate negatively. The data needs to be received from the GPU, stalling the `RenderingServer` in the process. For performance prefer the use of e.g. collision shapes or creating the data arrays entirely in code.

> method query_path(parameters: NavigationPathQueryParameters3D, result: NavigationPathQueryResult3D, callback: Callable = Callable()) -> void

Queries a path in a given navigation map. Start and target position and other parameters are defined through `NavigationPathQueryParameters3D`. Updates the provided `NavigationPathQueryResult3D` result object with the path among other results requested by the query. After the process is finished the optional `callback` will be called.

> method region_bake_navigation_mesh(navigation_mesh: NavigationMesh, root_node: Node) -> void ; deprecated=This method is deprecated due to core threading changes. To upgrade existing code, first create a `NavigationMeshSourceGeometryData3D` resource. Use this resource with `parse_source_geometry_data` to parse the `SceneTree` for nodes that should contribute to the navigation mesh baking. The `SceneTree` parsing needs to happen on the main thread. After the parsing is finished use the resource with `bake_from_source_geometry_data` to bake a navigation mesh.

Bakes the `navigation_mesh` with bake source geometry collected starting from the `root_node`.

Returns the enter cost of this `region`.

> method region_get_iteration_id(region: RID) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the current iteration ID of the navigation region. Every time the navigation region changes and synchronizes, the iteration ID increases. An iteration ID of `0` means the navigation region has never synchronized.
**Note:** The iteration ID will wrap around to `1` after reaching its range limit.

> method region_get_map(region: RID) -> RID ; qualifiers=const

Returns the navigation map `RID` the requested `region` is currently assigned to.

Returns the global transformation of this `region`.

> method region_get_travel_cost(region: RID) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the travel cost of this `region`.

> method region_get_use_async_iterations(region: RID) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the `region` uses an async synchronization process that runs on a background thread.

> method region_get_use_edge_connections(region: RID) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the navigation `region` is set to use edge connections to connect with other navigation regions within proximity of the navigation map edge connection margin.

> method region_owns_point(region: RID, point: Vector3) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the provided `point` in world space is currently owned by the provided navigation `region`. Owned in this context means that one of the region's navigation mesh polygon faces has a possible position at the closest distance to this point compared to all other navigation meshes from other navigation regions that are also registered on the navigation map of the provided region.
If multiple navigation meshes have positions at equal distance the navigation region whose polygons are processed first wins the ownership. Polygons are processed in the same order that navigation regions were registered on the NavigationServer.
**Note:** If navigation meshes from different navigation regions overlap (which should be avoided in general) the result might not be what is expected.

Sets the map for the region.

> method region_set_navigation_layers(region: RID, navigation_layers: int) -> void

Set the region's navigation layers. This allows selecting regions from a path request (when using `NavigationServer3D.map_get_path`).

> method region_set_navigation_mesh(region: RID, navigation_mesh: NavigationMesh) -> void

Sets the navigation mesh for the region.

> method region_set_owner_id(region: RID, owner_id: int) -> void

Set the `ObjectID` of the object which manages this region.

> method region_set_transform(region: RID, transform: Transform3D) -> void

Sets the global transformation for the region.

> method region_set_travel_cost(region: RID, travel_cost: float) -> void

Sets the `travel_cost` for this `region`.

> method region_set_use_async_iterations(region: RID, enabled: bool) -> void

If `enabled` is `true` the `region` uses an async synchronization process that runs on a background thread.

> method region_set_use_edge_connections(region: RID, enabled: bool) -> void

If `enabled` is `true`, the navigation `region` will use edge connections to connect with other navigation regions within proximity of the navigation map edge connection margin.

> method set_active(active: bool) -> void

Control activation of this server.

> method set_debug_enabled(enabled: bool) -> void

If `true` enables debug mode on the NavigationServer.

> method simplify_path(path: PackedVector3Array, epsilon: float) -> PackedVector3Array

Returns a simplified version of `path` with less critical path points removed. The simplification amount is in worlds units and controlled by `epsilon`. The simplification uses a variant of Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm for curve point decimation.
Path simplification can be helpful to mitigate various path following issues that can arise with certain agent types and script behaviors. E.g. "steering" agents or avoidance in "open fields".

> method source_geometry_parser_create() -> RID

Creates a new source geometry parser. If a `Callable` is set for the parser with `source_geometry_parser_set_callback` the callback will be called for every single node that gets parsed whenever `parse_source_geometry_data` is used.

> method source_geometry_parser_set_callback(parser: RID, callback: Callable) -> void

Sets the `callback` `Callable` for the specific source geometry `parser`. The `Callable` will receive a call with the following parameters:
- `navigation_mesh` - The `NavigationMesh` reference used to define the parse settings. Do NOT edit or add directly to the navigation mesh.
- `source_geometry_data` - The `NavigationMeshSourceGeometryData3D` reference. Add custom source geometry for navigation mesh baking to this object.
- `node` - The `Node` that is parsed.

## Signals

> signal avoidance_debug_changed()

Emitted when avoidance debug settings are changed. Only available in debug builds.

> signal map_changed(map: RID)

Emitted when a navigation map is updated, when a region moves or is modified.

> signal navigation_debug_changed()

Emitted when navigation debug settings are changed. Only available in debug builds.
