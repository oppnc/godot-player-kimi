# EditorSettings

> class EditorSettings
> inherits EditorSettings Resource

## Brief

Object that holds the project-independent editor settings.

## Description

Object that holds the project-independent editor settings. These settings are generally visible in the **Editor > Editor Settings** menu.
Property names use slash delimiters to distinguish sections. Setting values can be of any `Variant` type. It's recommended to use `snake_case` for editor settings to be consistent with the Godot editor itself.
Editor settings are saved automatically when changed.
Accessing the settings can be done using the following methods, such as:

```gdscript
        var settings = EditorInterface.get_editor_settings()
        # `settings.set("some/property", 10)` also works as this class overrides `_set()` internally.
        settings.set_setting("some/property", 10)
        # `settings.get("some/property")` also works as this class overrides `_get()` internally.
        settings.get_setting("some/property")
        var list_of_settings = settings.get_property_list()

```

```csharp
        EditorSettings settings = EditorInterface.Singleton.GetEditorSettings();
        // `settings.set("some/property", value)` also works as this class overrides `_set()` internally.
        settings.SetSetting("some/property", Value);
        // `settings.get("some/property", value)` also works as this class overrides `_get()` internally.
        settings.GetSetting("some/property");
        Godot.Collections.Array<Godot.Collections.Dictionary> listOfSettings = settings.GetPropertyList();

```

**Note:** This class shouldn't be instantiated directly. Instead, access the singleton using `EditorInterface.get_editor_settings`.

## Properties

> property asset_store/available_urls : Dictionary

A list of the available URLs that can be chosen in the Asset Store to fetch asset data. With the key being the name, and the value being the URL.

> property asset_store/use_threads : bool

If `true`, the Asset Store uses multiple threads for its HTTP requests. This prevents the Asset Store from blocking the main thread for every loaded asset.

> property debugger/auto_switch_to_remote_scene_tree : bool

If `true`, automatically switches to the **Remote** scene tree when running the project from the editor. If `false`, stays on the **Local** scene tree when running the project from the editor.
**Warning:** Enabling this setting can cause stuttering when running a project with a large amount of nodes (typically a few thousands of nodes or more), even if the editor window isn't focused. This is due to the remote scene tree being updated every second regardless of whether the editor is focused.

> property debugger/auto_switch_to_stack_trace : bool

If `true`, automatically switches to the **Stack Trace** panel when the debugger hits a breakpoint or steps.

> property debugger/max_node_selection : int

The limit of how many remote nodes can be selected at once.
**Warning:** Increasing this value is not recommended, as selecting too many can make the editing and inspection of remote properties unreliable.

> property debugger/profile_native_calls : bool

If `true`, enables collection of profiling data from non-GDScript Godot functions, such as engine class methods. Enabling this slows execution while profiling further.

> property debugger/profiler_frame_history_size : int

The size of the profiler's frame history. The default value (3600) allows seeing up to 60 seconds of profiling if the project renders at a constant 60 FPS. Higher values allow viewing longer periods of profiling in the graphs, especially when the project is running at high framerates.

> property debugger/profiler_frame_max_functions : int

The maximum number of script functions that can be displayed per frame in the profiler. If there are more script functions called in a given profiler frame, these functions will be discarded from the profiling results entirely.
**Note:** This setting is only read when the profiler is first started, so changing it during profiling will have no effect.

> property debugger/profiler_target_fps : int

The target frame rate shown in the visual profiler graph, in frames per second.

> property debugger/remote_inspect_refresh_interval : float

The refresh interval for the remote inspector's properties (in seconds). Lower values are more reactive, but may cause stuttering while the project is running from the editor and the **Remote** scene tree is selected in the Scene tree dock.

> property debugger/remote_scene_tree_refresh_interval : float

The refresh interval for the remote scene tree (in seconds). Lower values are more reactive, but may cause stuttering while the project is running from the editor and the **Remote** scene tree is selected in the Scene tree dock.

> property docks/filesystem/always_show_folders : bool

If `true`, displays folders in the FileSystem dock's bottom pane when split mode is enabled. If `false`, only files will be displayed in the bottom pane. Split mode can be toggled by pressing the icon next to the `res://` folder path.
**Note:** This setting has no effect when split mode is disabled (which is the default).

> property docks/filesystem/ask_before_moving_files : bool

If `true`, displays a confirmation dialog when moving or duplicating items in the FileSystem dock. This dialog can also be bypassed by holding `Shift`.

> property docks/filesystem/automatically_open_created_scripts : bool

If `true`, scripts created in FileSystem dock will be automatically edited.

> property docks/filesystem/other_file_extensions : String

A comma separated list of unsupported file extensions to show in the FileSystem dock, e.g. `"ico,icns"`.

> property docks/filesystem/textfile_extensions : String

A comma separated list of file extensions to consider as editable text files in the FileSystem dock (by double-clicking on the files), e.g. `"txt,md,cfg,ini,log,json,yml,yaml,toml,xml"`.

> property docks/filesystem/thumbnail_size : int

The thumbnail size to use in the FileSystem dock (in pixels). See also `filesystem/file_dialog/thumbnail_size`.

> property docks/property_editor/auto_refresh_interval : float

The refresh interval to use for the Inspector dock's properties. The effect of this setting is mainly noticeable when adjusting gizmos in the 2D/3D editor and looking at the inspector at the same time. Lower values make the inspector refresh more often, but take up more CPU time.

> property docks/property_editor/subresource_hue_tint : float

The tint intensity to use for the subresources background in the Inspector dock. The tint is used to distinguish between different subresources in the inspector. Higher values result in a more noticeable background color difference.

> property docks/scene_tree/accessibility_warnings : bool

If `true`, accessibility related warnings are displayed alongside other configuration warnings.

> property docks/scene_tree/ask_before_deleting_related_animation_tracks : bool

If `true`, when a node is deleted with animation tracks referencing it, a confirmation dialog appears before the tracks are deleted. The dialog will appear even when using the "Delete (No Confirm)" shortcut.

> property docks/scene_tree/ask_before_revoking_unique_name : bool

If `true`, displays a confirmation dialog after left-clicking the "percent" icon next to a node name in the Scene tree dock. When clicked, this icon revokes the node's scene-unique name, which can impact the behavior of scripts that rely on this scene-unique name due to identifiers not being found anymore.

> property docks/scene_tree/auto_expand_to_selected : bool

If `true`, the scene tree dock will automatically unfold nodes when a node that has folded parents is selected.

> property docks/scene_tree/center_node_on_reparent : bool

If `true`, new node created when reparenting node(s) will be positioned at the average position of the selected node(s).

> property docks/scene_tree/hide_filtered_out_parents : bool

If `true`, the scene tree dock will only show nodes that match the filter, without showing parents that don't. This settings can also be changed in the Scene dock's top menu.

> property docks/scene_tree/start_create_dialog_fully_expanded : bool

If `true`, the Create dialog (Create New Node/Create New Resource) will start with all its sections expanded. Otherwise, sections will be collapsed until the user starts searching (which will automatically expand sections as needed).

> property editors/2d/auto_resample_delay : float

Delay time for automatic resampling in the 2D editor (in seconds).

> property editors/2d/bone_color1 : Color

The "start" stop of the color gradient to use for bones in the 2D skeleton editor.

**Note:** Changes to this value only apply after modifying a `Bone2D` node in any way, or closing and reopening the scene.

> property editors/2d/bone_selected_color : Color

The color to use for selected bones in the 2D skeleton editor. See also `editors/2d/bone_outline_color`.

> property editors/2d/bone_width : float

The bone width in the 2D skeleton editor (in pixels). See also `editors/2d/bone_outline_size`.
**Note:** Changes to this value only apply after modifying a `Bone2D` node in any way, or closing and reopening the scene.

> property editors/2d/grid_color : Color

The grid color to use in the 2D editor.

> property editors/2d/guides_color : Color

The guides color to use in the 2D editor. Guides can be created by dragging the mouse cursor from the rulers.

> property editors/2d/locked_selection_rectangle_color : Color

The color to use for the selection rectangle that surrounds selected locked nodes in the 2D editor viewport.

> property editors/2d/ruler_width : float

The thickness of the coordinate ruler in the 2D editor. Increasing this will also increase the size of the ruler font, improving readability when using a lower editor scale. The editor may force a minimum size to keep the ruler numbers legible.

> property editors/2d/selection_rectangle_color : Color

The color to use for the selection rectangle outlines that surrounds selected nodes in the 2D editor viewport.

> property editors/2d/smart_snapping_line_color : Color

The color to use when drawing smart snapping lines in the 2D editor. The smart snapping lines will automatically display when moving 2D nodes if smart snapping is enabled in the Snapping Options menu at the top of the 2D editor viewport.

> property editors/2d/use_integer_zoom_by_default : bool

If `true`, the 2D editor will snap to integer zoom values when not holding the `Alt` key. If `false`, this behavior is swapped.

> property editors/2d/viewport_border_color : Color

The color of the viewport border in the 2D editor. This border represents the viewport's size at the base resolution defined in the Project Settings. Objects placed outside this border will not be visible unless a `Camera2D` node is used, or unless the window is resized and the stretch mode is set to `disabled`.

> property editors/2d/zoom_speed_factor : float

The factor to use when zooming in or out in the 2D editor. For example, `1.1` will zoom in by 10% with every step. If set to `2.0`, zooming will only cycle through powers of two.

> property editors/3d/active_selection_box_color : Color

The color to use for the active selection box that surrounds selected nodes in the 3D editor viewport.
**Note:** The term "active" indicates that this object is the primary selection used as the basis for certain operations. This is the last selected `Node3D`, which can be reordered with `Shift + Left mouse button`.

> property editors/3d/default_fov : float

The default camera vertical field of view to use in the 3D editor (in degrees). The camera field of view can be adjusted on a per-scene basis using the **View** menu at the top of the 3D editor. If a scene had its camera field of view adjusted using the **View** menu, this setting is ignored in the scene in question. This setting is also ignored while a `Camera3D` node is being previewed in the editor.
**Note:** The editor camera always uses the **Keep Height** aspect mode.

> property editors/3d/default_z_far : float

The default camera far clip distance to use in the 3D editor (in degrees). Higher values make it possible to view objects placed further away from the camera, at the cost of lower precision in the depth buffer (which can result in visible Z-fighting in the distance). The camera far clip distance can be adjusted on a per-scene basis using the **View** menu at the top of the 3D editor. If a scene had its camera far clip distance adjusted using the **View** menu, this setting is ignored in the scene in question. This setting is also ignored while a `Camera3D` node is being previewed in the editor.

> property editors/3d/default_z_near : float

The default camera near clip distance to use in the 3D editor (in degrees). Lower values make it possible to view objects placed closer to the camera, at the cost of lower precision in the depth buffer (which can result in visible Z-fighting in the distance). The camera near clip distance can be adjusted on a per-scene basis using the **View** menu at the top of the 3D editor. If a scene had its camera near clip distance adjusted using the **View** menu, this setting is ignored in the scene in question. This setting is also ignored while a `Camera3D` node is being previewed in the editor.

> property editors/3d/freelook/freelook_activation_modifier : int

The modifier key to use to enable freelook in the 3D editor (on top of pressing the right mouse button).
**Note:** Regardless of this setting, the freelook toggle keyboard shortcut (`Shift + F` by default) is always available.
**Note:** On certain window managers on Linux, the `Alt` key will be intercepted by the window manager when clicking a mouse button at the same time. This means Godot will not see the modifier key as being pressed.

> property editors/3d/freelook/freelook_base_speed : float

The base 3D freelook speed in units per second. This can be adjusted by using the mouse wheel while in freelook mode, or by holding down the "fast" or "slow" modifier keys (`Shift` and `Alt` by default, respectively).

> property editors/3d/freelook/freelook_inertia : float

The inertia of the 3D freelook camera. Higher values make the camera start and stop slower, which looks smoother but adds latency.

> property editors/3d/freelook/freelook_invert_y_axis : bool

If `true`, invert the vertical mouse axis when using freelook mode in the 3D editor.

> property editors/3d/freelook/freelook_navigation_scheme : int

The navigation scheme to use when freelook is enabled in the 3D editor. Some of the navigation schemes below may be more convenient when designing specific levels in the 3D editor.
- **Default:** The "Freelook Forward", "Freelook Backward", "Freelook Up" and "Freelook Down" keys will move relative to the camera, taking its pitch angle into account for the movement.
- **Partially Axis-Locked:** The "Freelook Forward" and "Freelook Backward" keys will move relative to the camera, taking its pitch angle into account for the movement. The "Freelook Up" and "Freelook Down" keys will move in an "absolute" manner, *not* taking the camera's pitch angle into account for the movement.
- **Fully Axis-Locked:** The "Freelook Forward", "Freelook Backward", "Freelook Up" and "Freelook Down" keys will move in an "absolute" manner, *not* taking the camera's pitch angle into account for the movement.
See also `editors/3d/navigation/navigation_scheme`.

> property editors/3d/freelook/freelook_sensitivity : float

The mouse sensitivity to use while freelook mode is active in the 3D editor. See also `editors/3d/navigation_feel/orbit_sensitivity`.

> property editors/3d/freelook/freelook_speed_zoom_link : bool

If `true`, freelook speed is linked to the zoom value used in the camera orbit mode in the 3D editor.

> property editors/3d/grid_division_level_bias : float

The grid division bias to use in the 3D editor. Negative values will cause small grid divisions to appear earlier, whereas positive values will cause small grid divisions to appear later.

> property editors/3d/grid_division_level_max : int

The largest grid division to use in the 3D editor. Together with `editors/3d/primary_grid_steps`, this determines how large the grid divisions can be. The grid divisions will not be able to get larger than `primary_grid_steps ^ grid_division_level_max` units. By default, when `editors/3d/primary_grid_steps` is `8`, this means grid divisions cannot get larger than `64` units each (so primary grid lines are `512` units apart), no matter how far away the camera is from the grid.

> property editors/3d/grid_division_level_min : int

The smallest grid division to use in the 3D editor. Together with `editors/3d/primary_grid_steps`, this determines how small the grid divisions can be. The grid divisions will not be able to get smaller than `primary_grid_steps ^ grid_division_level_min` units. By default, this means grid divisions cannot get smaller than 1 unit each, no matter how close the camera is from the grid.

> property editors/3d/grid_size : int

The grid size in units. Higher values prevent the grid from appearing "cut off" at certain angles, but make the grid more demanding to render. Depending on the camera's position, the grid may not be fully visible since a shader is used to fade it progressively.

> property editors/3d/grid_xy_plane : bool

If `true`, renders the grid on the XY plane in perspective view. This can be useful for 3D side-scrolling games.

> property editors/3d/grid_xz_plane : bool

> property editors/3d/navigation/emulate_numpad : bool

If `true`, allows using the top row `0`-`9` keys to function as their equivalent numpad keys for 3D editor navigation. This should be enabled on keyboards that have no numeric keypad available.

> property editors/3d/navigation/invert_x_axis : bool

If `true`, invert the horizontal mouse axis when panning or orbiting in the 3D editor. This setting does *not* apply to freelook mode.

> property editors/3d/navigation/invert_y_axis : bool

If `true`, invert the vertical mouse axis when panning or orbiting in the 3D editor.

> property editors/3d/navigation/navigation_scheme : int

The navigation scheme preset to use in the 3D editor. Changing this setting will affect the mouse button and modifier keys used to navigate the 3D editor viewport.
All schemes can use `Mouse wheel` to zoom.
- **Godot:** `Middle mouse button` to orbit. `Shift + Middle mouse button` to pan. `Ctrl + Middle mouse button` to zoom.
- **Maya:** `Alt + Left mouse button` to orbit. `Middle mouse button` to pan, `Shift + Middle mouse button` to pan 10 times faster. `Alt + Right mouse button` to zoom.
- **Modo:** `Alt + Left mouse button` to orbit. `Alt + Shift + Left mouse button` to pan. `Ctrl + Alt + Left mouse button` to zoom.
- **Tablet/Trackpad:** `Alt` to orbit. `Shift` to pan. `Ctrl` to zoom. Enables 3-button mouse emulation mode.
See also `editors/3d/navigation/orbit_mouse_button`, `editors/3d/navigation/pan_mouse_button`, `editors/3d/navigation/zoom_mouse_button`, `editors/3d/freelook/freelook_navigation_scheme`, and `editors/3d/navigation/emulate_3_button_mouse`.
**Note:** On certain window managers on Linux, the `Alt` key will be intercepted by the window manager when clicking a mouse button at the same time. This means Godot will not see the modifier key as being pressed.

If `false`, the behavior is reversed, i.e. the dialog only appears when Shift is held.

> property editors/animation/default_animation_step : float

Default step used when creating a new `Animation` in the Animation bottom panel. Only affects the first animation created in the `AnimationPlayer`. By default, other newly created animations will use the step from the previous ones.
This value is always expressed in seconds. If you want e.g. `10` FPS to be the default, you need to set the default step to `0.1`.

> property editors/animation/default_create_bezier_tracks : bool

> property editors/panning/zoom_style : int

The mouse cursor movement direction to use when drag-zooming in any editor (except 3D scene editor) by moving the mouse. This does not affect zooming with the mouse wheel.

> property editors/polygon_editor/auto_bake_delay : float

The delay in seconds until more complex and performance costly polygon editors commit their outlines, e.g. the 2D navigation polygon editor rebakes the navigation mesh polygons. A negative value stops the auto bake.

> property editors/polygon_editor/point_grab_radius : int

The radius in which points can be selected in the `Polygon2D` and `CollisionPolygon2D` editors (in pixels). Higher values make it easier to select points quickly, but can make it more difficult to select the expected point when several points are located close to each other.

> property editors/polygon_editor/show_previous_outline : bool

If `true`, displays the polygon's previous shape in the 2D polygon editors with an opaque gray outline. This outline is displayed while dragging a point until the left mouse button is released.

> property editors/shader_editor/behavior/files/restore_shaders_on_load : bool

If `true`, reopens shader files that were open in the shader editor when the project was last closed.

> property editors/visual_editors/grid_pattern : int

The pattern used for the background grid.

> property editors/visual_editors/lines_curvature : float

The curvature to use for connection lines in the visual shader editor. Higher values will make connection lines appear more curved, with values above `0.5` resulting in more "angular" turns in the middle of connection lines.

> property editors/visual_editors/minimap_opacity : float

The opacity of the minimap displayed in the bottom-right corner of the visual shader editor.

> property editors/visual_editors/visual_shader/port_preview_size : int

The size to use for port previews in the visual shader uniforms (toggled by clicking the "eye" icon next to an output). The value is defined in pixels at 100% zoom, and will scale with zoom automatically.

> property export/ssh/scp : String

Path to the SCP (secure copy) executable (used for remote deploy to desktop platforms). If left empty, the editor will attempt to run `scp` from `PATH`.
**Note:** SCP is not the same as SFTP. Specifying the SFTP executable here will not work.

> property export/ssh/ssh : String

Path to the SSH executable (used for remote deploy to desktop platforms). If left empty, the editor will attempt to run `ssh` from `PATH`.

> property filesystem/directories/autoscan_project_path : String

The folder where projects should be scanned for (recursively), in a way similar to the project manager's **Scan** button. This can be set to the same value as `filesystem/directories/default_project_path` for convenience.
**Note:** Setting this path to a folder with very large amounts of files/folders can slow down the project manager startup significantly. To keep the project manager quick to start up, it is recommended to set this value to a folder as "specific" as possible.

> property filesystem/directories/default_project_path : String

The folder where new projects should be created by default when clicking the project manager's **New Project** button. This can be set to the same value as `filesystem/directories/autoscan_project_path` for convenience.

> property filesystem/external_programs/3d_model_editor : String

The program that opens 3D model scene files when clicking "Open in External Program" option in Filesystem Dock. If not specified, the file will be opened in the system's default program.

> property filesystem/external_programs/audio_editor : String

The program that opens audio files when clicking "Open in External Program" option in Filesystem Dock. If not specified, the file will be opened in the system's default program.

> property filesystem/external_programs/raster_image_editor : String

The program that opens raster image files when clicking "Open in External Program" option in Filesystem Dock. If not specified, the file will be opened in the system's default program.

> property filesystem/external_programs/terminal_emulator : String

The terminal emulator program to use when using **Open in Terminal** context menu action in the FileSystem dock. You can enter an absolute path to a program binary, or a path to a program that is present in the `PATH` environment variable.
If left empty, Godot will use the default terminal emulator for the system:
- **Windows:** PowerShell
- **macOS:** Terminal.app
- **Linux:** The first terminal found on the system in this order: gnome-terminal, konsole, xfce4-terminal, lxterminal, kitty, alacritty, urxvt, xterm.
To use Command Prompt (cmd) instead of PowerShell on Windows, enter `cmd` in this field and the correct flags will automatically be used.
On macOS, make sure to point to the actual program binary located within the `Programs/MacOS` folder of the .app bundle, rather than the .app bundle directory.
If specifying a custom terminal emulator, you may need to override `filesystem/external_programs/terminal_emulator_flags` so it opens in the correct folder.

> property filesystem/external_programs/terminal_emulator_flags : String

The command-line arguments to pass to the terminal emulator that is run when using **Open in Terminal** context menu action in the FileSystem dock. See also `filesystem/external_programs/terminal_emulator`.
If left empty, the default flags are `{directory}`, which is replaced by the absolute path to the directory that is being opened in the terminal.
**Note:** If the terminal emulator is set to PowerShell, cmd, or Konsole, Godot will automatically prepend arguments to this list, as these terminals require nonstandard arguments to open in the correct folder.

> property filesystem/external_programs/vector_image_editor : String

The program that opens vector image files when clicking "Open in External Program" option in Filesystem Dock. If not specified, the file will be opened in the system's default program.

> property filesystem/file_dialog/display_mode : int

The display mode to use in the editor's file dialogs.
- **Thumbnails** takes more space, but displays dynamic resource thumbnails, making resources easier to preview without having to open them.
- **List** is more compact but doesn't display dynamic resource thumbnails. Instead, it displays static icons based on the file extension.

> property filesystem/file_dialog/show_hidden_files : bool

If `true`, display hidden files in the editor's file dialogs. Files that have names starting with `.` are considered hidden (e.g. `.hidden_file`).

> property filesystem/file_dialog/thumbnail_size : int

The thumbnail size to use in the editor's file dialogs (in pixels). See also `docks/filesystem/thumbnail_size`.

> property filesystem/file_server/password : String

Password used for file server when exporting project with remote file system.

> property filesystem/file_server/port : int

Port used for file server when exporting project with remote file system.

> property filesystem/import/blender/blender_path : String

The path to the Blender executable used for converting the Blender 3D scene files `.blend` to glTF 2.0 format during import. Blender 3.0 or later is required.
To enable this feature for your specific project, use `ProjectSettings.filesystem/import/blender/enabled`.
If this setting is empty, Blender's default paths will be detected and used automatically if present in this order:
**Windows:**

```text
            - C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\blender.exe
            - C:\Program Files (x86)\Blender Foundation\blender.exe

```

**macOS:**

```text
            - /opt/homebrew/bin/blender
            - /opt/local/bin/blender
            - /usr/local/bin/blender
            - /usr/local/opt/blender
            - /Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender

```

**Linux/*BSD:**

```text
            - /usr/bin/blender
            - /usr/local/bin/blender
            - /opt/blender/bin/blender

```

> property filesystem/import/blender/rpc_port : int

The port number used for Remote Procedure Call (RPC) communication with Godot's created process of the blender executable.
Setting this to 0 effectively disables communication with Godot and the blender process, making performance slower.

> property filesystem/import/blender/rpc_server_uptime : float

The maximum idle uptime (in seconds) of the Blender process.
This prevents Godot from having to create a new process for each import within the given seconds.

> property filesystem/import/fbx/fbx2gltf_path : String

The path to the FBX2glTF executable used for converting Autodesk FBX 3D scene files `.fbx` to glTF 2.0 format during import.
To enable this feature for your specific project, use `ProjectSettings.filesystem/import/fbx2gltf/enabled`.

> property filesystem/on_save/compress_binary_resources : bool

If `true`, uses lossless compression for binary resources.

> property filesystem/on_save/safe_save_on_backup_then_rename : bool

If `true`, when saving a file, the editor will rename the old file to a different name, save a new file, then only remove the old file once the new file has been saved. This makes loss of data less likely to happen if the editor or operating system exits unexpectedly while saving (e.g. due to a crash or power outage).
**Note:** On Windows, this feature can interact negatively with certain antivirus programs. In this case, you may have to set this to `false` to prevent file locking issues.

> property filesystem/on_save/warn_on_saving_large_text_resources : bool

If `true`, displays a warning toast message when saving a text-based scene or resource that is larger than 500 KiB on disk. This is typically caused by binary subresources being embedded as text, which results in slow and inefficient conversion to text. This in turn impacts scene saving and loading times.
This should usually be resolved by moving the embedded binary subresource to its own binary resource file (`.res` extension instead of `.tres`). This is the preferred approach. Alternatively, the entire scene can be saved with the binary `.scn` format as opposed to `.tscn`, but this will make it less friendly to version control systems.

> property filesystem/quick_open_dialog/default_display_mode : int

If set to `Adaptive`, the dialog opens in list view or grid view depending on the requested type. If set to `Last Used`, the display mode will always open the way you last used it.

> property filesystem/quick_open_dialog/enable_fuzzy_matching : bool

If `true`, together with exact matches of a filename, the dialog includes approximate matches.
This is useful for finding the correct files even when there are typos in the search query; for example, searching "nprmal" will find "normal". Additionally, it allows you to write shorter search queries; for example, searching "nml" will also find "normal".
See also `filesystem/quick_open_dialog/max_fuzzy_misses`.

> property filesystem/quick_open_dialog/include_addons : bool

If `true`, results will include files located in the `addons` folder.

> property filesystem/quick_open_dialog/instant_preview : bool

If `true`, highlighting a resource will preview it quickly without confirming the selection or closing the dialog.

> property filesystem/quick_open_dialog/max_fuzzy_misses : int

The number of missed query characters allowed in a match when fuzzy matching is enabled. For example, with the default value of `2`, `"normal"` would match `"narmal"` and `"norma"` but not `"nor"`.

> property filesystem/quick_open_dialog/max_results : int

Maximum number of matches to show in dialog.

> property filesystem/quick_open_dialog/show_search_highlight : bool

If `true`, results will be highlighted with their search matches.

> property filesystem/tools/oidn/oidn_denoise_path : String

The path to the directory containing the Open Image Denoise (OIDN) executable, used optionally for denoising lightmaps. It can be downloaded from [openimagedenoise.org](https://www.openimagedenoise.org/downloads.html).
To enable this feature for your specific project, use `ProjectSettings.rendering/lightmapping/denoising/denoiser`.

> property input/buffering/agile_event_flushing : bool

If `true`, input events will be flushed just before every idle and physics frame.
If `false`, these events will be flushed only once per process frame, between iterations of the engine.
Enabling this setting can greatly improve input responsiveness, especially in devices that struggle to run at the project's intended frame rate.

> property input/buffering/use_accumulated_input : bool

If `true`, similar input events sent by the operating system are accumulated. When input accumulation is enabled, all input events generated during a frame will be merged and emitted when the frame is done rendering. Therefore, this limits the number of input method calls per second to the rendering FPS.
Input accumulation can be disabled to get slightly more precise/reactive input at the cost of increased CPU usage.
**Note:** Input accumulation is *enabled* by default.

> property interface/accessibility/accessibility_support : int

Editor accessibility support mode:
- **Auto** (`0`): Accessibility support is enabled, but updates to the accessibility information are processed only if an assistive app (such as a screen reader or a Braille display) is active (default).
- **Always Active** (`1`): Accessibility support is enabled, and updates to the accessibility information are always processed, regardless of the status of assistive apps.
- **Disabled** (`2`): Accessibility support is fully disabled.
**Note:** Accessibility debugging tools, such as Accessibility Insights for Windows, Accessibility Inspector (macOS), or AT-SPI Browser (Linux/BSD), do not count as assistive apps. To test the editor with these tools, use **Always Active**.

> property interface/accessibility/property_descriptions : bool

If `true`, editor inspector uses property documentation as an accessible description of the property.

> property interface/editor/appearance/accept_dialog_cancel_ok_buttons : int

How to position the Cancel and OK buttons in the editor's `AcceptDialog` windows. Different platforms have different conventions for this, which can be overridden through this setting to avoid accidental clicks when using Godot on multiple platforms.
- **Auto** follows the platform convention: OK first on Windows, KDE, and LXQt; Cancel first on macOS and other Linux desktop environments.
- **Cancel First** forces the Cancel/OK ordering.
- **OK First** forces the OK/Cancel ordering.
To check if these buttons are swapped at runtime, use `DisplayServer.get_swap_cancel_ok`.

> property interface/editor/appearance/collapse_main_menu : bool

If `true`, the main menu collapses into a `MenuButton`.
**Note:** This setting is only applicable on macOS when `interface/editor/appearance/use_embedded_menu` is `true`.
**Note:** Defaults to `true` on the Android editor.

> property interface/editor/appearance/custom_display_scale : float

The custom editor scale factor to use. This can be used for displays with very high DPI where a scale factor of 200% is not sufficient.
**Note:** Only effective if `interface/editor/appearance/display_scale` is set to **Custom**.

> property interface/editor/appearance/display_scale : int

The display scale factor to use for the editor interface. Higher values are more suited to hiDPI/Retina displays.
If set to **Auto**, the editor scale is automatically determined based on the screen resolution and reported display DPI. This heuristic is not always ideal, which means you can get better results by setting the editor scale manually.
If set to **Custom**, the scaling value in `interface/editor/appearance/custom_display_scale` will be used.

> property interface/editor/appearance/editor_screen : int

The preferred monitor to display the editor. If **Auto**, the editor will remember the last screen it was displayed on across multiple sessions.

> property interface/editor/appearance/expand_to_title : bool

Expanding main editor window content to the title, if supported by `DisplayServer`. See `DisplayServer.WINDOW_FLAG_EXTEND_TO_TITLE`.
Specific to the macOS platform.

> property interface/editor/appearance/project_manager_screen : int

The preferred monitor to display the project manager.

> property interface/editor/appearance/show_renderer_selector : bool

If `true`, a renderer selector that can be used to change the `ProjectSettings.rendering/renderer/rendering_method` project setting will be shown in the top right of the main editor window.

> property interface/editor/appearance/show_update_spinner : int

If enabled, displays an icon in the top-right corner of the editor that spins when the editor redraws a frame. This can be used to diagnose situations where the engine is constantly redrawing, which should be avoided as this increases CPU and GPU utilization for no good reason. To further troubleshoot these situations, start the editor with the `--debug-canvas-item-redraw` [command line argument]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/editor/command_line_tutorial.html).
Consider enabling this if you are developing editor plugins to ensure they only make the editor redraw when required.
The default **Auto** value will only enable this if the editor was compiled with the `dev_build=yes` SCons option (the default is `dev_build=no`).
**Note:** If `interface/editor/display/update_continuously` is `true`, the spinner icon displays in red.
**Note:** If the editor was started with the `--debug-canvas-item-redraw` [command line argument]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/editor/command_line_tutorial.html), the update spinner will *never* display regardless of this setting's value. This is to avoid confusion with what would cause redrawing in real world scenarios.

> property interface/editor/appearance/use_embedded_menu : bool

If `true`, editor main menu is using embedded `MenuBar` instead of system global menu.
Specific to the macOS platform.

> property interface/editor/appearance/use_native_file_dialogs : bool

If `true`, editor UI uses OS native file/directory selection dialogs.

> property interface/editor/behavior/automatically_open_screenshots : bool

If `true`, automatically opens screenshots with the default program associated to `.png` files after a screenshot is taken using the **Editor > Take Screenshot** action.

> property interface/editor/behavior/import_resources_when_unfocused : bool

If `true`, (re)imports resources even if the editor window is unfocused or minimized. If `false`, resources are only (re)imported when the editor window is focused. This can be set to `true` to speed up iteration by starting the import process earlier when saving files in the project folder. This also allows getting visual feedback on changes without having to click the editor window, which is useful with multi-monitor setups. The downside of setting this to `true` is that it increases idle CPU usage and may steal CPU time from other applications when importing resources.

> property interface/editor/behavior/save_each_scene_on_quit : bool

If `false`, the editor will save all scenes when confirming the **Save** action when quitting the editor or quitting to the project list. If `true`, the editor will ask to save each scene individually.

> property interface/editor/behavior/save_on_focus_loss : bool

If `true`, scenes and scripts are saved when the editor loses focus. Depending on the work flow, this behavior can be less intrusive than `text_editor/behavior/files/autosave_interval_secs` or remembering to save manually.

> property interface/editor/behavior/separate_distraction_mode : bool

If `true`, the editor's Script tab will have a separate distraction mode setting from the 2D/3D/Game/AssetLib tabs. If `false`, the distraction-free mode toggle is shared between all tabs.

> property interface/editor/behavior/show_internal_errors_in_toast_notifications : int

If enabled, displays internal engine errors in toast notifications (toggleable by clicking the "bell" icon at the bottom of the editor). No matter the value of this setting, non-internal engine errors will always be visible in toast notifications.
The default **Auto** value will only enable this if the editor was compiled with the `dev_build=yes` SCons option (the default is `dev_build=no`).

> property interface/editor/display/keep_screen_on : bool

If `true`, keeps the screen on (even in case of inactivity), so the screensaver does not take over. Works on desktop and mobile platforms.

> property interface/editor/display/single_window_mode : bool

If `true`, embed modal windows such as docks inside the main editor window. When single-window mode is enabled, tooltips will also be embedded inside the main editor window, which means they can't be displayed outside of the editor window. Single-window mode can be faster as it does not need to create a separate window for every popup and tooltip, which can be a slow operation depending on the operating system and rendering method in use.
This is equivalent to `ProjectSettings.display/window/subwindows/embed_subwindows` in the running project, except the setting's value is inverted.
**Note:** To query whether the editor can use multiple windows in an editor plugin, use `EditorInterface.is_multi_window_enabled` instead of querying the value of this editor setting.
**Note:** If `true`, game embedding is disabled.

> property interface/editor/display/update_continuously : bool

If `true`, redraws the editor every frame even if nothing has changed on screen. When this setting is enabled, the update spinner displays in red (see `interface/editor/appearance/show_update_spinner`).
**Warning:** This greatly increases CPU and GPU utilization, leading to increased power usage. This should only be enabled for troubleshooting purposes.

> property interface/editor/display/vsync_mode : int

Sets the V-Sync mode for the editor. Does not affect the project when run from the editor (this is controlled by `ProjectSettings.display/window/vsync/vsync_mode`).
Depending on the platform and used renderer, the engine will fall back to **Enabled** if the desired mode is not supported.
**Note:** V-Sync modes other than **Enabled** are only supported in the Forward+ and Mobile rendering methods, not Compatibility.

> property interface/editor/docks/bottom_dock_tab_style : int

Tab style of editor docks located at the bottom.

> property interface/editor/docks/dock_tab_style : int

Tab style of editor docks, except bottom docks.

> property interface/editor/fonts/code_font : String

The font to use for the script editor. Must be a resource of a `Font` type such as a `.ttf` or `.otf` font file.

> property interface/editor/fonts/code_font_contextual_ligatures : int

The font ligatures to enable for the currently configured code font. Not all fonts include support for ligatures.
**Note:** The default editor code font ([JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)) has contextual ligatures in its font file.

> property interface/editor/fonts/code_font_custom_opentype_features : String

List of custom OpenType features to use, if supported by the currently configured code font. Not all fonts include support for custom OpenType features. The string should follow the OpenType specification.
**Note:** The default editor code font ([JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)) has custom OpenType features in its font file, but there is no documented list yet.

> property interface/editor/fonts/code_font_custom_variations : String

List of alternative characters to use, if supported by the currently configured code font. Not all fonts include support for custom variations. The string should follow the OpenType specification.
**Note:** The default editor code font ([JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)) has alternate characters in its font file, but there is no documented list yet.

> property interface/editor/fonts/code_font_size : int

The size of the font in the script editor. This setting does not impact the font size of the Output panel (see `run/output/font_size`).

> property interface/editor/fonts/font_allow_msdf : bool

If set to `true`, MSDF font rendering will be used for the visual shader graph editor. You may need to set this to `false` when using a custom main font, as some fonts will look broken due to the use of self-intersecting outlines in their font data. Downloading the font from the font maker's official website as opposed to a service like Google Fonts can help resolve this issue.

> property interface/editor/fonts/font_antialiasing : int

FreeType's font anti-aliasing mode used to render the editor fonts. Most fonts are not designed to look good with anti-aliasing disabled, so it's recommended to leave this enabled unless you're using a pixel art font.

> property interface/editor/fonts/font_disable_embedded_bitmaps : bool

If set to `true`, embedded font bitmap loading is disabled (bitmap-only and color fonts ignore this property).

> property interface/editor/fonts/font_hinting : int

The font hinting mode to use for the editor fonts. FreeType supports the following font hinting modes:
- **None:** Don't use font hinting when rasterizing the font. This results in a smooth font, but it can look blurry.
- **Light:** Use hinting on the X axis only. This is a compromise between font sharpness and smoothness.
- **Normal:** Use hinting on both X and Y axes. This results in a sharp font, but it doesn't look very smooth.
If set to **Auto**, the font hinting mode will be set to match the current operating system in use. This means the **Light** hinting mode will be used on Windows and Linux, and the **None** hinting mode will be used on macOS.

> property interface/editor/fonts/font_subpixel_positioning : int

The subpixel positioning mode to use when rendering editor font glyphs. This affects both the main and code fonts. **Disabled** is the fastest to render and uses the least memory. **Auto** only uses subpixel positioning for small font sizes (where the benefit is the most noticeable). **One Half of a Pixel** and **One Quarter of a Pixel** force the same subpixel positioning mode for all editor fonts, regardless of their size (with **One Quarter of a Pixel** being the highest-quality option).

> property interface/editor/fonts/main_font : String

The font to use for the editor interface. Must be a resource of a `Font` type such as a `.ttf` or `.otf` font file.
**Note:** If the provided font is variable, a weight of 400 (normal) will be used.

> property interface/editor/fonts/main_font_bold : String

The font to use for bold text in the editor interface. Must be a resource of a `Font` type such as a `.ttf` or `.otf` font file.
**Note:** If the provided font is variable, a weight of 700 (bold) will be used.

> property interface/editor/fonts/main_font_custom_opentype_features : String

List of custom OpenType features to use, if supported by the currently configured main font. Check what OpenType features are supported by your font first.
The string should follow the OpenType specification, e.g. `ss01,tnum,calt=false`. Microsoft's documentation contains a list of [all registered features](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/featurelist).
**Note:** The default editor main font ([Inter](https://rsms.me/inter)) has custom OpenType features in its font file, with `ss04` and `tnum` enabled and `calt` disabled by default. Supported features can be found at its website.

> property interface/editor/fonts/main_font_size : int

The size of the font in the editor interface.

> property interface/editor/input/mouse_extra_buttons_navigate_history : bool

If `true`, the mouse's additional side buttons will be usable to navigate in the script editor's file history. Set this to `false` if you're using the side buttons for other purposes (such as a push-to-talk button in a VoIP program).

> property interface/editor/input/tablet_driver : int

Overrides the tablet driver used by the editor.

> property interface/editor/localization/editor_language : String

The language to use for the editor interface. If set to **Auto**, the language is automatically determined based on the system locale. See also `EditorInterface.get_editor_language`.
Translations are provided by the community. If you spot a mistake, [contribute to editor translations on Weblate!](https://contributing.godotengine.org/en/latest/documentation/translation/index.html)

> property interface/editor/localization/localize_settings : bool

If `true`, setting names in the editor are localized when possible.
**Note:** This setting affects most `EditorInspector`s in the editor UI, primarily Project Settings and Editor Settings. To control names displayed in the Inspector dock, use `interface/inspector/default_property_name_style` instead.

> property interface/editor/localization/ui_layout_direction : int

Editor UI default layout direction.

> property interface/editor/timers/dragging_hover_wait_seconds : float

During a drag-and-drop, this is how long to wait over a UI element before it triggers a reaction (e.g. a section unfolds to show nested items).

> property interface/editor/timers/low_processor_mode_sleep_usec : int

The amount of sleeping between frames in the editor (in microseconds). Higher values will result in lower CPU/GPU usage, which can improve battery life on laptops. However, higher values will result in a less responsive editor. The default value is set to allow for maximum smoothness on monitors up to 144 Hz. See also `interface/editor/timers/unfocused_low_processor_mode_sleep_usec`.
**Note:** This setting is ignored if `interface/editor/display/update_continuously` is `true`, as enabling that setting disables low-processor mode.

> property interface/editor/timers/unfocused_low_processor_mode_sleep_usec : int

When the editor window is unfocused, the amount of sleeping between frames when the low-processor usage mode is enabled (in microseconds). Higher values will result in lower CPU/GPU usage, which can improve battery life on laptops (in addition to improving the running project's performance if the editor has to redraw continuously). However, higher values will result in a less responsive editor. The default value is set to limit the editor to 10 FPS when the editor window is unfocused. See also `interface/editor/timers/low_processor_mode_sleep_usec`.
**Note:** This setting is ignored if `interface/editor/display/update_continuously` is `true`, as enabling that setting disables low-processor mode.

> property interface/editors/derive_script_globals_by_name : bool

If `true`, when extending a script, the global class name of the script is inserted in the script creation dialog, if it exists. If `false`, the script's file path is always inserted.

> property interface/inspector/auto_unfold_foreign_scenes : bool

If `true`, automatically unfolds Inspector property groups containing modified values when opening a scene for the first time. Only affects scenes without saved folding preferences and only unfolds groups with properties that have been changed from their default values.
**Note:** This setting only works in specific scenarios: when opening a scene brought in from another project, or when opening a new scene that already has modified properties (e.g., from version control). Duplicated scenes are not considered foreign, so this setting will not affect them.

> property interface/inspector/color_picker_show_intensity : bool

If `true`, show the intensity slider in the `ColorPicker`s opened in the editor.

> property interface/inspector/default_color_picker_mode : int

The default color picker mode to use when opening `ColorPicker`s in the editor. This mode can be temporarily adjusted on the color picker itself.

> property interface/inspector/default_color_picker_shape : int

The default color picker shape to use when opening `ColorPicker`s in the editor. This shape can be temporarily adjusted on the color picker itself.

> property interface/inspector/default_float_step : float

The floating-point precision to use for properties that don't define an explicit precision step. Lower values allow entering more precise values.

> property interface/inspector/default_property_name_style : int

The default property name style to display in the Inspector dock. This style can be temporarily adjusted in the Inspector dock's menu.
- **Raw:** Displays properties in `snake_case`.
- **Capitalized:** Displays properties capitalized.
- **Localized:** Displays the localized string for the current editor language if a translation is available for the given property. If no translation is available, falls back to **Capitalized**.
**Note:** To display translated setting names in Project Settings and Editor Settings, use `interface/editor/localization/localize_settings` instead.

> property interface/inspector/delimitate_all_container_and_resources : bool

If `true`, add a margin around Array, Dictionary, and Resource Editors that are not already colored.
**Note:** If `interface/inspector/nested_color_mode` is set to **Containers & Resources** this parameter will have no effect since those editors will already be colored.

If `true`, forces all property groups to be expanded in the Inspector dock and prevents collapsing them.

> property interface/inspector/float_drag_speed : float

Base speed for increasing/decreasing float values by dragging them in the inspector.

> property interface/inspector/horizontal_vector2_editing : bool

If `true`, `Vector2` and `Vector2i` properties are shown on a single line in the inspector instead of two lines. This is overall more compact, but it can be harder to view and edit large values without expanding the inspector horizontally.

> property interface/inspector/horizontal_vector_types_editing : bool

If `true`, `Vector3`, `Vector3i`, `Vector4`, `Vector4i`, `Rect2`, `Rect2i`, `Plane`, and `Quaternion` properties are shown on a single line in the inspector instead of multiple lines. This is overall more compact, but it can be harder to view and edit large values without expanding the inspector horizontally.

> property interface/inspector/integer_drag_speed : float

Base speed for increasing/decreasing integer values by dragging them in the inspector.

> property interface/inspector/max_array_dictionary_items_per_page : int

The number of `Array` or `Dictionary` items to display on each "page" in the inspector. Higher values allow viewing more values per page, but take more time to load. This increased load time is noticeable when selecting nodes that have array or dictionary properties in the editor.

> property interface/inspector/nested_color_mode : int

Control which property editors are colored when they are opened.
- **Containers & Resources:** Color all Array, Dictionary, and Resource Editors.
- **Resources:** Color all Resource Editors.
- **External Resources:** Color Resource Editors that edits an external resource.

> property interface/inspector/open_resources_in_current_inspector : bool

If `true`, subresources can be edited in the current inspector view. If the resource type is defined in `interface/inspector/resources_to_open_in_new_inspector` or if this setting is `false`, attempting to edit a subresource always opens a new inspector view.

> property interface/inspector/resources_to_open_in_new_inspector : PackedStringArray

List of resources that should always be opened in a new inspector view, even if `interface/inspector/open_resources_in_current_inspector` is `true`.

> property interface/inspector/show_low_level_opentype_features : bool

If `true`, display OpenType features marked as `hidden` by the font file in the `Font` editor.

> property interface/multi_window/enable : bool

If `true`, multiple window support in editor is enabled. The following panels can become dedicated windows (i.e. made floating): Docks, Script editor, Shader editor, and Game Workspace.
**Note:** When `interface/editor/display/single_window_mode` is `true`, the multi window support is always disabled.
**Note:** To query whether the editor can use multiple windows in an editor plugin, use `EditorInterface.is_multi_window_enabled` instead of querying the value of this editor setting.

> property interface/multi_window/maximize_window : bool

If `true`, when panels are made floating they will be maximized.
If `false`, when panels are made floating their position and size will match the ones when they are attached (excluding window border) to the editor window.

> property interface/multi_window/restore_windows_on_load : bool

If `true`, the floating panel position, size, and screen will be saved on editor exit. On next launch the panels that were floating will be made floating in the saved positions, sizes and screens, if possible.

> property interface/scene_tabs/auto_select_current_scene_file : bool

If `true`, the FileSystem dock will automatically navigate to the currently selected scene tab.

> property interface/scene_tabs/display_close_button : int

> property interface/scene_tabs/maximum_width : int

The maximum width of each scene tab at the top editor (in pixels).

> property interface/scene_tabs/restore_scenes_on_load : bool

If `true`, when a project is loaded, restores scenes that were opened on the last editor session.
**Note:** With many opened scenes, the editor may take longer to become usable. If starting the editor quickly is necessary, consider setting this to `false`.

> property interface/scene_tabs/show_script_button : bool

If `true`, show a button next to each scene tab that opens the scene's "dominant" script when clicked. The "dominant" script is the one that is at the highest level in the scene's hierarchy.

> property interface/scene_tabs/show_thumbnail_on_hover : bool

If `true`, display an automatically-generated thumbnail when hovering scene tabs with the mouse. Scene thumbnails are generated when saving the scene.

> property interface/theme/accent_color : Color

The color to use for "highlighted" user interface elements in the editor (pressed and hovered items).

> property interface/theme/additional_spacing : int

The extra spacing to add to various GUI elements in the editor (in pixels). Increasing this value is useful to improve usability on touch screens, at the cost of reducing the amount of usable screen real estate.
See also `interface/theme/spacing_preset`.

> property interface/theme/base_color : Color

The base color to use for user interface elements in the editor. Secondary colors (such as darker/lighter variants) are derived from this color.

The base spacing used by various GUI elements in the editor (in pixels). See also `interface/theme/spacing_preset`.

> property interface/theme/border_size : int

The border size to use for interface elements (in pixels).

> property interface/theme/color_preset : String

The editor color preset to use.

> property interface/theme/contrast : float

The contrast factor to use when deriving the editor theme's base color (see `interface/theme/base_color`). When using positive values, the derived colors will be *darker* than the base color. This contrast factor can be set to a negative value, which will make the derived colors *brighter* than the base color. Negative contrast rates often look better for light themes.

> property interface/theme/corner_radius : int

The corner radius to use for interface elements (in pixels). `0` is square.

> property interface/theme/custom_theme : String

The custom theme resource to use for the editor. Must be a Godot theme resource in `.tres` or `.res` format.

> property interface/theme/draw_extra_borders : bool

If `true`, draws additional borders around interactive UI elements in the editor. This is automatically enabled when using the **Black (OLED)** theme preset, as this theme preset uses a fully black background.

> property interface/theme/draw_relationship_lines : int

What relationship lines to draw in the editor's `Tree`-based GUIs (such as the Scene tree dock).
- **None** will make it so that no relationship lines are drawn.
- **Selected Only** will only draw them for selected items.
- **All** will always draw them for all items.

> property interface/theme/follow_system_theme : bool

If `true`, the editor theme preset will attempt to automatically match the system theme.

The icon and font color scheme to use in the editor.
- **Auto** determines the color scheme to use automatically based on `interface/theme/base_color`.
- **Dark** makes fonts and icons dark (suitable for light themes). Icon colors are automatically converted by the editor following the set of rules defined in [this file](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/editor/themes/editor_theme_manager.cpp).
- **Light** makes fonts and icons light (suitable for dark themes).

> property interface/theme/icon_saturation : float

The saturation to use for editor icons. Higher values result in more vibrant colors.
**Note:** The default editor icon saturation was increased by 30% in Godot 4.0 and later. To get Godot 3.x's icon saturation back, set `interface/theme/icon_saturation` to `0.77`.

> property interface/theme/relationship_line_opacity : float

The opacity to use when drawing relationship lines in the editor's `Tree`-based GUIs (such as the Scene tree dock).

> property interface/theme/spacing_preset : String

If `true`, the device will vibrate when a long-press gesture triggers a right-click context menu in the editor.
**Note:** Only has an effect on devices with haptic feedback hardware. Defaults to `true` on touchscreen devices.

> property interface/touchscreen/scale_gizmo_handles : float

Specify the multiplier to apply to the scale for the editor gizmo handles to improve usability on touchscreen devices.
**Note:** Defaults to `1` on non-touchscreen devices.

> property interface/touchscreen/touch_actions_panel : int

A touch-friendly panel that provides easy access to common actions such as save, delete, undo, and redo without requiring a keyboard.
**Note:** Only available in the Android and XR editor.

> property network/connection/check_for_updates : int

Specifies how the engine should check for updates.
- **Disable Update Checks** will block the engine from checking updates (see also `network/connection/network_mode`).
- **Auto** (default) will check for newest stable or unstable version, depending on which version are you currently using. Switch to another option if you want to lock in.
- **Check Newest Preview** will check for the newest available development snapshot.
- **Check Newest Stable** will check for the newest available stable version.
- **Check Newest Patch** will check for the latest available stable version, but only within the same minor version. E.g. if your version is `4.3.stable`, you will be notified about `4.3.1.stable`, but not `4.4.stable`.
All update modes will ignore builds with different major versions (e.g. Godot 4 -> Godot 5).

> property network/connection/network_mode : int

Determines whether online features, such as the Asset Store or update checks, are enabled in the editor. If this is a privacy concern, disabling these online features prevents the editor from making HTTP requests to the Godot website or third-party platforms hosting assets from the Asset Store.
Editor plugins and tool scripts are recommended to follow this setting. However, Godot can't prevent them from violating this rule.

> property network/debug/remote_host : String

The address to listen to when starting the remote debugger. This can be set to this device's local IP address to allow external clients to connect to the remote debugger (instead of restricting the remote debugger to connections from `localhost`).

> property network/debug/remote_port : int

The port to listen to when starting the remote debugger. Godot will try to use port numbers above the configured number if the configured number is already taken by another application.

> property network/http_proxy/host : String

The host to use to contact the HTTP and HTTPS proxy in the editor (for the asset store and export template downloads). See also `network/http_proxy/port`.
**Note:** Godot currently doesn't automatically use system proxy settings, so you have to enter them manually here if needed.

> property network/http_proxy/port : int

The port number to use to contact the HTTP and HTTPS proxy in the editor (for the asset store and export template downloads). See also `network/http_proxy/host`.
**Note:** Godot currently doesn't automatically use system proxy settings, so you have to enter them manually here if needed.

> property network/language_server/enable_smart_resolve : bool

If `true` the language server will try to provide additional results when resolving symbols at the cost of showing wrong results. All symbols in the project are checked and resolved just based on their name, without taking context into account.

```text
            func untyped(param):
                param.print() # Will resolve to the global print method for e.g. hover hints.

```

When using static typing it is recommended to disable this setting, since it will mostly add false positives for typed code.
**Note:** This setting also influences how symbols are resolved when using renaming capabilities.
**Note:** The default value of this setting might change in future versions.

> property network/language_server/poll_limit_usec : int

The upper limit of time, that the language server spends for IO each poll.

> property network/language_server/remote_host : String

The host used to listen for language server clients.

> property network/language_server/remote_port : int

The port used to listen for language server clients.
**Note:** A port configured with command-line options will take priority over this setting: `--lsp-port <port>`.

> property network/language_server/show_native_symbols_in_editor : bool

The declaration of native symbols can't be resolved to a position in the file system. If `true` the language server will instead open the documentation for native symbols in the editor.
**Note:** The VSCode plugin adds additional functionality which allows viewing Godot documentation directly in VSCode, so this option is usually not needed in VSCode.

> property network/language_server/use_thread : bool

If `true` the language server will run in a separate thread, if `false` it will run on the main thread.

> property network/tls/editor_tls_certificates : String

The TLS certificate bundle to use for HTTP requests made within the editor (e.g. from the Asset Store tab). If left empty, the [included Mozilla certificate bundle](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/thirdparty/certs/ca-bundle.crt) will be used.

> property network/tls/enable_tls_v1.3 : bool

If `true`, enable TLSv1.3 negotiation.
**Note:** Only supported when using Mbed TLS 3.0 or later (Linux distribution packages may be compiled against older system Mbed TLS packages), otherwise the maximum supported TLS version is always TLSv1.2.

> property project_manager/default_renderer : String

The renderer type that will be checked off by default when creating a new project. Accepted strings are "forward_plus", "mobile" or "gl_compatibility".

> property project_manager/directory_naming_convention : int

> property project_manager/sorting_order : int

The sorting order to use in the project manager. When changing the sorting order in the project manager, this setting is set permanently in the editor settings.

> property run/auto_save/save_before_running : bool

If `true`, saves all scenes and scripts automatically before running the project. Setting this to `false` prevents the editor from saving if there are no changes which can speed up the project startup slightly, but it makes it possible to run a project that has unsaved changes. (Unsaved changes will not be visible in the running project.)

> property run/bottom_panel/action_on_play : int

The action to execute on the bottom panel when running the project.
**Note:** This option won't do anything if the bottom panel switching is locked using the pin button in the corner of the bottom panel.

> property run/bottom_panel/action_on_stop : int

The action to execute on the bottom panel when stopping the project.
**Note:** This option won't do anything if the bottom panel switching is locked using the pin button in the corner of the bottom panel.

> property run/window_placement/screen : int

The monitor to display the project on when starting the project from the editor.

> property text_editor/appearance/caret/caret_blink : bool

If `true`, makes the caret blink according to `text_editor/appearance/caret/caret_blink_interval`. Disabling this setting can improve battery life on laptops if you spend long amounts of time in the script editor, since it will reduce the frequency at which the editor needs to be redrawn.

> property text_editor/appearance/caret/caret_blink_interval : float

The interval at which the caret will blink (in seconds). See also `text_editor/appearance/caret/caret_blink`.

> property text_editor/appearance/caret/highlight_all_occurrences : bool

If `true`, highlights all occurrences of the currently selected text in the script editor. See also `text_editor/theme/highlighting/word_highlighted_color`.

> property text_editor/appearance/caret/highlight_current_line : bool

If `true`, colors the background of the line the caret is currently on with `text_editor/theme/highlighting/current_line_color`.

> property text_editor/appearance/caret/type : int

The shape of the caret to use in the script editor. **Line** displays a vertical line to the left of the current character, whereas **Block** displays an outline over the current character.

> property text_editor/appearance/drag_and_drop_info/show_drag_and_drop_info : bool

If `true`, shows an info label listing available drop options when dragging an object into the script text editor.

> property text_editor/appearance/enable_inline_color_picker : bool

> property text_editor/appearance/guidelines/line_length_guideline_hard_column : int

The column at which to display a subtle line as a line length guideline for scripts. This should generally be greater than `text_editor/appearance/guidelines/line_length_guideline_soft_column`.

> property text_editor/appearance/guidelines/line_length_guideline_soft_column : int

The column at which to display a *very* subtle line as a line length guideline for scripts. This should generally be lower than `text_editor/appearance/guidelines/line_length_guideline_hard_column`.

> property text_editor/appearance/guidelines/show_line_length_guidelines : bool

If `true`, displays line length guidelines to help you keep line lengths in check. See also `text_editor/appearance/guidelines/line_length_guideline_soft_column` and `text_editor/appearance/guidelines/line_length_guideline_hard_column`.

> property text_editor/appearance/gutters/highlight_type_safe_lines : bool

If `true`, highlights type-safe lines by displaying their line number color with `text_editor/theme/highlighting/safe_line_number_color` instead of `text_editor/theme/highlighting/line_number_color`. Type-safe lines are lines of code where the type of all variables is known at compile-time. These type-safe lines may run faster thanks to typed instructions.

> property text_editor/appearance/gutters/line_numbers_zero_padded : bool

If `true`, displays line numbers with zero padding (e.g. `007` instead of `7`).

> property text_editor/appearance/gutters/show_info_gutter : bool

If `true`, displays a gutter at the left containing icons for methods with signal connections and for overridden methods.

> property text_editor/appearance/gutters/show_line_numbers : bool

If `true`, displays line numbers in a gutter at the left.

> property text_editor/appearance/lines/autowrap_mode : int

If `text_editor/appearance/lines/word_wrap` is set to `1`, sets text wrapping mode. To see how each mode behaves, see `TextServer.AutowrapMode`.

> property text_editor/appearance/lines/code_folding : bool

If `true`, displays the folding arrows next to indented code sections and allows code folding. If `false`, hides the folding arrows next to indented code sections and disallows code folding.

> property text_editor/appearance/lines/word_wrap : int

If `true`, wraps long lines over multiple lines to avoid horizontal scrolling. This is a display-only feature; it does not actually insert line breaks in your scripts.

> property text_editor/appearance/minimap/minimap_width : int

The width of the minimap in the script editor (in pixels).

> property text_editor/appearance/minimap/show_minimap : bool

If `true`, draws an overview of the script near the scroll bar. The minimap can be left-clicked to scroll directly to a location in an "absolute" manner.

> property text_editor/appearance/whitespace/draw_spaces : bool

If `true`, draws space characters as centered points.

> property text_editor/appearance/whitespace/draw_tabs : bool

If `true`, draws tab characters as chevrons.

> property text_editor/appearance/whitespace/line_spacing : int

The space to add between lines (in pixels). Greater line spacing can help improve readability at the cost of displaying fewer lines on screen. Negative values allow for even more compact text, but may look broken with certain fonts.

> property text_editor/behavior/documentation/enable_tooltips : bool

If `true`, documentation tooltips will appear when hovering over a symbol.

> property text_editor/behavior/files/auto_reload_and_parse_scripts_on_save : bool

If `true`, tool scripts will be automatically soft-reloaded after they are saved.

> property text_editor/behavior/files/auto_reload_scripts_on_external_change : bool

If `true`, automatically reloads scripts and text-based shaders in the editor when they have been modified and saved by external editors or tools and the editor regains focus. External changes can be discarded by using the Undo function after they've been loaded in the editor.
If `false`, a file conflict dialog will always be displayed when the editor regains focus. This dialog allows you to choose whether to keep local changes or discard them.
**Note:** Even when this setting is `true`, a file conflict dialog is still displayed in certain situations. For instance, it will display when the script editor has unsaved changes that the external editor did not account for.

> property text_editor/behavior/files/autosave_interval_secs : int

- `name`: `String` (the name of the property)
- `type`: `int` (see `Variant.Type`)
- optionally `hint`: `int` (see `PropertyHint`) and `hint_string`: `String`

```gdscript
                var settings = EditorInterface.get_editor_settings()
                settings.set("category/property_name", 0)

                var property_info = {
                    "name": "category/property_name",
                    "type": TYPE_INT,
                    "hint": PROPERTY_HINT_ENUM,
                    "hint_string": "one,two,three"
                }

                settings.add_property_info(property_info)

```

```csharp
                var settings = GetEditorInterface().GetEditorSettings();
                settings.Set("category/property_name", 0);

                var propertyInfo = new Godot.Collections.Dictionary
                {
                    { "name", "category/propertyName" },
                    { "type", Variant.Type.Int },
                    { "hint", PropertyHint.Enum },
                    { "hint_string", "one,two,three" },
                };

                settings.AddPropertyInfo(propertyInfo);

```

> method add_shortcut(path: String, shortcut: Shortcut) -> void

Adds a `shortcut` whose path is specified by `path`.
The `path` determines how the shortcut is organized and displayed in the editor's shortcut settings. The path format affects the display as follows:
- `"name"` (no slash): Creates a category named `name` with the shortcut displayed as `name`.
- `"category/name"` (single slash): Displays as `name` in the `category` section.
- `"category/name/extra"` (multiple slashes): Extra path components are ignored, so this behaves the same as `"category/name"`.
**Note:** Shortcuts are only saved to the editor settings if they differ from their original/default state. This means empty shortcuts that were originally empty will not persist between editor sessions and must be re-added. If a shortcut with the same `path` already exists, this method will update it with the new `shortcut` instead of creating a duplicate.

```text
                # Add a custom shortcut for a plugin action.
                var my_shortcut = Shortcut.new()
                var input_event = InputEventKey.new()
                input_event.keycode = KEY_F5
                input_event.ctrl_pressed = true
                my_shortcut.events.append(input_event)

                # This will appear under the "My Plugin" category as "Reload Data".
                EditorInterface.get_editor_settings().add_shortcut("my_plugin/reload_data", my_shortcut)

                # This will appear under the "Test Action" category as "Test Action".
                EditorInterface.get_editor_settings().add_shortcut("test_action", my_shortcut)

```
