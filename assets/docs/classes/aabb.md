# AABB

> class AABB

## Brief

A 3D axis-aligned bounding box.

## Description

The `AABB` built-in `Variant` type represents an axis-aligned bounding box in a 3D space. It is defined by its `position` and `size`, which are `Vector3`. It is frequently used for fast overlap tests (see `intersects`). Although `AABB` itself is axis-aligned, it can be combined with `Transform3D` to represent a rotated or skewed bounding box.
It uses floating-point coordinates. The 2D counterpart to `AABB` is `Rect2`. There is no version of `AABB` that uses integer coordinates.
**Note:** Negative values for `size` are not supported. With negative size, most `AABB` methods do not work correctly. Use `abs` to get an equivalent `AABB` with a non-negative size.
**Note:** In a boolean context, an `AABB` evaluates to `false` if both `position` and `size` are zero (equal to `Vector3.ZERO`). Otherwise, it always evaluates to `true`.

## Properties

> property end : Vector3 ; default=Vector3(0, 0, 0)

The ending point. This is usually the corner on the top-right and back of the bounding box, and is equivalent to `position + size`. Setting this point affects the `size`.

> property position : Vector3 ; default=Vector3(0, 0, 0)

The origin point. This is usually the corner on the bottom-left and forward of the bounding box.

> property size : Vector3 ; default=Vector3(0, 0, 0)

The bounding box's width, height, and depth starting from `position`. Setting this value also affects the `end` point.
**Note:** It's recommended setting the width, height, and depth to non-negative values. This is because most methods in Godot assume that the `position` is the bottom-left-forward corner, and the `end` is the top-right-back corner. To get an equivalent bounding box with non-negative size, use `abs`.

## Constructors

> constructor AABB()

Constructs an `AABB` with its `position` and `size` set to `Vector3.ZERO`.

> constructor AABB(from: AABB)

Constructs an `AABB` as a copy of the given `AABB`.

> constructor AABB(position: Vector3, size: Vector3)

Constructs an `AABB` by `position` and `size`.

## Methods

> method abs() -> AABB ; qualifiers=const

Returns an `AABB` equivalent to this bounding box, with its width, height, and depth modified to be non-negative values.

```gdscript
                var box = AABB(Vector3(5, 0, 5), Vector3(-20, -10, -5))
                var absolute = box.abs()
                print(absolute.position) # Prints (-15.0, -10.0, 0.0)
                print(absolute.size)     # Prints (20.0, 10.0, 5.0)

```

```csharp
                var box = new Aabb(new Vector3(5, 0, 5), new Vector3(-20, -10, -5));
                var absolute = box.Abs();
                GD.Print(absolute.Position); // Prints (-15, -10, 0)
                GD.Print(absolute.Size);     // Prints (20, 10, 5)

```

**Note:** It's recommended to use this method when `size` is negative, as most other methods in Godot assume that the `size`'s components are greater than `0`.

> method encloses(with: AABB) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this bounding box *completely* encloses the `with` box. The edges of both boxes are included.

```gdscript
                var a = AABB(Vector3(0, 0, 0), Vector3(4, 4, 4))
                var b = AABB(Vector3(1, 1, 1), Vector3(3, 3, 3))
                var c = AABB(Vector3(2, 2, 2), Vector3(8, 8, 8))

                print(a.encloses(a)) # Prints true
                print(a.encloses(b)) # Prints true
                print(a.encloses(c)) # Prints false

```

```csharp
                var a = new Aabb(new Vector3(0, 0, 0), new Vector3(4, 4, 4));
                var b = new Aabb(new Vector3(1, 1, 1), new Vector3(3, 3, 3));
                var c = new Aabb(new Vector3(2, 2, 2), new Vector3(8, 8, 8));

                GD.Print(a.Encloses(a)); // Prints True
                GD.Print(a.Encloses(b)); // Prints True
                GD.Print(a.Encloses(c)); // Prints False

```

> method expand(to_point: Vector3) -> AABB ; qualifiers=const

Returns a copy of this bounding box expanded to align the edges with the given `to_point`, if necessary.

```gdscript
                var box = AABB(Vector3(0, 0, 0), Vector3(5, 2, 5))

                box = box.expand(Vector3(10, 0, 0))
                print(box.position) # Prints (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
                print(box.size)     # Prints (10.0, 2.0, 5.0)

                box = box.expand(Vector3(-5, 0, 5))
                print(box.position) # Prints (-5.0, 0.0, 0.0)
                print(box.size)     # Prints (15.0, 2.0, 5.0)

```

```csharp
                var box = new Aabb(new Vector3(0, 0, 0), new Vector3(5, 2, 5));

                box = box.Expand(new Vector3(10, 0, 0));
                GD.Print(box.Position); // Prints (0, 0, 0)
                GD.Print(box.Size);     // Prints (10, 2, 5)

                box = box.Expand(new Vector3(-5, 0, 5));
                GD.Print(box.Position); // Prints (-5, 0, 0)
                GD.Print(box.Size);     // Prints (15, 2, 5)

```

> method get_center() -> Vector3 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the center point of the bounding box. This is the same as `position + (size / 2.0)`.

> method get_endpoint(idx: int) -> Vector3 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the position of one of the 8 vertices that compose this bounding box. With an `idx` of `0` this is the same as `position`, and an `idx` of `7` is the same as `end`.

> method get_longest_axis() -> Vector3 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the longest normalized axis of this bounding box's `size`, as a `Vector3` (`Vector3.RIGHT`, `Vector3.UP`, or `Vector3.BACK`).

```gdscript
                var box = AABB(Vector3(0, 0, 0), Vector3(2, 4, 8))

                print(box.get_longest_axis())       # Prints (0.0, 0.0, 1.0)
                print(box.get_longest_axis_index()) # Prints 2
                print(box.get_longest_axis_size())  # Prints 8.0

```

```csharp
                var box = new Aabb(new Vector3(0, 0, 0), new Vector3(2, 4, 8));

                GD.Print(box.GetLongestAxis());      // Prints (0, 0, 1)
                GD.Print(box.GetLongestAxisIndex()); // Prints Z
                GD.Print(box.GetLongestAxisSize());  // Prints 8

> method grow(by: float) -> AABB ; qualifiers=const

Returns a copy of this bounding box extended on all sides by the given amount `by`. A negative amount shrinks the box instead.

```gdscript
                var a = AABB(Vector3(4, 4, 4), Vector3(8, 8, 8)).grow(4)
                print(a.position) # Prints (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
                print(a.size)     # Prints (16.0, 16.0, 16.0)

                var b = AABB(Vector3(0, 0, 0), Vector3(8, 4, 2)).grow(2)

                GD.Print(a.Position); // Prints (0, 0, 0)
                GD.Print(a.Size);     // Prints (16, 16, 16)

                var b = new Aabb(new Vector3(0, 0, 0), new Vector3(8, 4, 2)).Grow(2);
                GD.Print(b.Position); // Prints (-2, -2, -2)
                GD.Print(b.Size);     // Prints (12, 8, 6)

```

> method has_point(point: Vector3) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the bounding box contains the given `point`. By convention, points exactly on the right, top, and front sides are **not** included.
**Note:** This method is not reliable for `AABB` with a *negative* `size`. Use `abs` first to get a valid bounding box.

> method has_surface() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this bounding box has a surface or a length, that is, at least one component of `size` is greater than `0`. Otherwise, returns `false`.

> method has_volume() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this bounding box's width, height, and depth are all positive. See also `get_volume`.

> method intersection(with: AABB) -> AABB ; qualifiers=const

Returns the intersection between this bounding box and `with`. If the boxes do not intersect, returns an empty `AABB`. If the boxes intersect at the edge, returns a flat `AABB` with no volume (see `has_surface` and `has_volume`).

```gdscript
                var box1 = AABB(Vector3(0, 0, 0), Vector3(5, 2, 8))
                var box2 = AABB(Vector3(2, 0, 2), Vector3(8, 4, 4))

                var intersection = box1.intersection(box2)
                print(intersection.position) # Prints (2.0, 0.0, 2.0)
                print(intersection.size)     # Prints (3.0, 2.0, 4.0)

```

```csharp
                var box1 = new Aabb(new Vector3(0, 0, 0), new Vector3(5, 2, 8));
                var box2 = new Aabb(new Vector3(2, 0, 2), new Vector3(8, 4, 4));

                var intersection = box1.Intersection(box2);
                GD.Print(intersection.Position); // Prints (2, 0, 2)
                GD.Print(intersection.Size);     // Prints (3, 2, 4)

```

**Note:** If you only need to know whether two bounding boxes are intersecting, use `intersects`, instead.

> method intersects(with: AABB) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this bounding box overlaps with the box `with`. The edges of both boxes are *always* excluded.

> method intersects_plane(plane: Plane) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this bounding box is on both sides of the given `plane`.

> method intersects_ray(from: Vector3, dir: Vector3) -> Variant ; qualifiers=const

Returns the first point where this bounding box and the given ray intersect, as a `Vector3`. If no intersection occurs, returns `null`.
The ray begin at `from`, faces `dir` and extends towards infinity.

> method intersects_segment(from: Vector3, to: Vector3) -> Variant ; qualifiers=const

Returns the first point where this bounding box and the given segment intersect, as a `Vector3`. If no intersection occurs, returns `null`.
The segment begins at `from` and ends at `to`.

> method is_equal_approx(aabb: AABB) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this bounding box and `aabb` are approximately equal, by calling `Vector3.is_equal_approx` on the `position` and the `size`.

> method is_finite() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this bounding box's values are finite, by calling `Vector3.is_finite` on the `position` and the `size`.

> method merge(with: AABB) -> AABB ; qualifiers=const

Returns an `AABB` that encloses both this bounding box and `with` around the edges. See also `encloses`.

## Operators

> operator !=(right: AABB) -> bool

Returns `true` if the `position` or `size` of both bounding boxes are not equal.
**Note:** Due to floating-point precision errors, consider using `is_equal_approx` instead, which is more reliable.

> operator *(right: Transform3D) -> AABB

Inversely transforms (multiplies) the `AABB` by the given `Transform3D` transformation matrix, under the assumption that the transformation basis is orthonormal (i.e. rotation/reflection is fine, scaling/skew is not).
`aabb * transform` is equivalent to `transform.inverse() * aabb`. See `Transform3D.inverse`.
For transforming by inverse of an affine transformation (e.g. with scaling) `transform.affine_inverse() * aabb` can be used instead. See `Transform3D.affine_inverse`.

> operator ==(right: AABB) -> bool

Returns `true` if both `position` and `size` of the bounding boxes are exactly equal, respectively.
**Note:** Due to floating-point precision errors, consider using `is_equal_approx` instead, which is more reliable.
