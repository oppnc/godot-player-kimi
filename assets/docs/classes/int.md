# int

> class int

## Brief

A built-in type for integers.

## Description

Signed 64-bit integer type. This means that it can take values from `-2^63` to `2^63 - 1`, i.e. from `-9223372036854775808` to `9223372036854775807`. When it exceeds these bounds, it will wrap around.
`int`s can be automatically converted to `float`s when necessary, for example when passing them as arguments in functions. The `float` will be as close to the original integer as possible.
Likewise, `float`s can be automatically converted into `int`s. This will truncate the `float`, discarding anything after the floating-point.
**Note:** In a boolean context, an `int` will evaluate to `false` if it equals `0`, and to `true` otherwise.

```gdscript
        var x: int = 1 # x is 1
        x = 4.2 # x is 4, because 4.2 gets truncated
        var max_int = 9223372036854775807 # Biggest value an int can store
        max_int += 1 # max_int is -9223372036854775808, because it wrapped around

```

```csharp
        int x = 1; // x is 1
        x = (int)4.2; // x is 4, because 4.2 gets truncated
        // We use long below, because GDScript's int is 64-bit while C#'s int is 32-bit.
        long maxLong = 9223372036854775807; // Biggest value a long can store
        maxLong++; // maxLong is now -9223372036854775808, because it wrapped around.

        // Alternatively with C#'s 32-bit int type, which has a smaller maximum value.
        int maxInt = 2147483647; // Biggest value an int can store
        maxInt++; // maxInt is now -2147483648, because it wrapped around

```

You can use the `0b` literal for binary representation, the `0x` literal for hexadecimal representation, and the `_` symbol to separate long numbers and improve readability.

```gdscript
        var x = 0b1001 # x is 9
        var y = 0xF5 # y is 245
        var z = 10_000_000 # z is 10000000

```

```csharp
        int x = 0b1001; // x is 9
        int y = 0xF5; // y is 245
        int z = 10_000_000; // z is 10000000

```

## Constructors

> constructor int()

Constructs an `int` set to `0`.

> constructor int(from: int)

Constructs an `int` as a copy of the given `int`.

> constructor int(from: String)

Constructs a new `int` from a `String`, following the same rules as `String.to_int`.

> constructor int(from: bool)

Constructs a new `int` from a `bool`. `true` is converted to `1` and `false` is converted to `0`.

> constructor int(from: float)

Constructs a new `int` from a `float`. This will truncate the `float`, discarding anything after the floating point.

## Operators

> operator !=(right: float) -> bool

Returns `true` if the `int` is not equivalent to the `float`.

> operator !=(right: int) -> bool

Returns `true` if the `int`s are not equal.

> operator %(right: int) -> int

Returns the remainder after dividing two `int`s. Uses truncated division, which returns a negative number if the dividend is negative. If this is not desired, consider using `@GlobalScope.posmod`.

```text
                print(6 % 2) # Prints 0
                print(11 % 4) # Prints 3
                print(-5 % 3) # Prints -2

```

> operator &(right: int) -> int

Performs the bitwise `AND` operation.

```text
                print(0b1100 & 0b1010) # Prints 8 (binary 1000)

```

This is useful for retrieving binary flags from a variable.

```text
                var flags = 0b101
                # Check if the first or second bit are enabled.
                if flags & 0b011:
                    do_stuff() # This line will run.

```

> operator *(right: Color) -> Color

Multiplies each component of the `Color` by the `int`.

> operator *(right: Quaternion) -> Quaternion

Multiplies each component of the `Quaternion` by the `int`. This operation is not meaningful on its own, but it can be used as a part of a larger expression.

> operator *(right: Vector2) -> Vector2

Multiplies each component of the `Vector2` by the `int`.

```text
                print(2 * Vector2(1, 4)) # Prints (2, 8)

```

> operator *(right: int) -> int

> operator **(right: float) -> float

```text
                print(2 ** 0.5) # Prints 1.4142135623731

```

> operator **(right: int) -> int

Raises the left `int` to a power of the right `int`.

```text
                print(3 ** 4) # Prints 81

```

> operator +(right: float) -> float

Adds the `int` and the `float`. The result is a `float`.

> operator +(right: int) -> int

Adds the two `int`s.

> operator -(right: float) -> float

Subtracts the `float` from the `int`. The result is a `float`.

> operator -(right: int) -> int

Subtracts the two `int`s.

> operator /(right: float) -> float

Divides the `int` by the `float`. The result is a `float`.

```text
                print(10 / 3.0) # Prints 3.33333333333333

```

> operator /(right: int) -> int

Divides the two `int`s. The result is an `int`. This will truncate the `float`, discarding anything after the floating point.

```text
                print(6 / 2) # Prints 3
                print(5 / 3) # Prints 1

```

> operator <(right: float) -> bool

Returns `true` if the `int` is less than the `float`.

> operator <(right: int) -> bool

Returns `true` if the left `int` is less than the right `int`.

> operator <<(right: int) -> int

Performs the bitwise shift left operation. Effectively the same as multiplying by a power of 2.

```text
                print(0b1010 << 1) # Prints 20 (binary 10100)
                print(0b1010 << 3) # Prints 80 (binary 1010000)

```

> operator <=(right: float) -> bool

> operator <=(right: int) -> bool

Returns `true` if the left `int` is less than or equal to the right `int`.

> operator ==(right: float) -> bool

> operator >=(right: int) -> bool

Returns `true` if the left `int` is greater than or equal to the right `int`.

> operator >>(right: int) -> int

Performs the bitwise shift right operation. Effectively the same as dividing by a power of 2.

```text
                print(0b1010 >> 1) # Prints 5 (binary 101)
                print(0b1010 >> 2) # Prints 2 (binary 10)

```

> operator ^(right: int) -> int

Performs the bitwise `XOR` operation.

```text
                print(0b1100 ^ 0b1010) # Prints 6 (binary 110)

```

> operator unary+() -> int

Returns the same value as if the `+` was not there. Unary `+` does nothing, but sometimes it can make your code more readable.

> operator unary-() -> int

Returns the negated value of the `int`. If positive, turns the number negative. If negative, turns the number positive. If zero, does nothing.

> operator |(right: int) -> int

Performs the bitwise `OR` operation.

```text
                print(0b1100 | 0b1010) # Prints 14 (binary 1110)

```

This is useful for storing binary flags in a variable.

```text
                var flags = 0
                flags |= 0b101 # Turn the first and third bits on.

```

> operator ~() -> int

Performs the bitwise `NOT` operation on the `int`. Due to [2's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement), it's effectively equal to `-(int + 1)`.

```text
                print(~4) # Prints -5
                print(~(-7)) # Prints 6

```
