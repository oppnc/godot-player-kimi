# DrawableTexture2D

> class DrawableTexture2D
> inherits DrawableTexture2D Texture2D

## Brief

A 2D texture that supports drawing to itself via Blit calls.

## Description

A 2D texture that can be modified via blit calls, copying from a target texture to itself. Primarily intended to be managed in code, a user must call `setup` to initialize the state before drawing. Each `blit_rect` call takes at least a rectangle, the area to draw to, and another texture, what to be drawn. The draw calls use a Texture_Blit Shader to process and calculate the result, pixel by pixel. Users can supply their own ShaderMaterial with custom Texture_Blit shaders for more complex behaviors.

## Properties

## Methods

> method blit_rect(rect: Rect2i, source: Texture2D, modulate: Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1), mipmap: int = 0, material: Material = null) -> void ; experimental=This method may be changed or removed in future versions.

Draws to given `rect` on this texture by copying from the given `source`. A `modulate` color can be passed in for the shader to use, but defaults to White. The `mipmap` value can specify a draw to a lower mipmap level. The `material` parameter can take a ShaderMaterial with a TextureBlit Shader for custom drawing behavior.

> method blit_rect_multi(rect: Rect2i, sources: Array[Texture2D], extra_targets: Array[DrawableTexture2D], modulate: Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1), mipmap: int = 0, material: Material = null) -> void ; experimental=This method may be changed or removed in future versions.

Draws to the given `rect` on this texture, as well as on up to 3 DrawableTexture `extra_targets`. All `extra_targets` must be the same size and DrawableFormat as the original target, otherwise the Shader may fail. Expects up to 4 Texture `sources`, but will replace missing `sources` with default Black Textures.

> method generate_mipmaps() -> void

Re-calculates the mipmaps for this texture on demand.

> method get_use_mipmaps() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if mipmaps are set to be used on this DrawableTexture.

> method set_format(format: DrawableFormat) -> void

Sets the format of this DrawableTexture.

> method set_use_mipmaps(mipmaps: bool) -> void

Sets if mipmaps should be used on this DrawableTexture.

> method setup(width: int, height: int, format: DrawableFormat, color: Color = Color(1, 1, 1, 1), use_mipmaps: bool = false) -> void ; experimental=This method may be changed or removed in future versions.

Initializes the DrawableTexture to a White texture of the given `width`, `height`, and `format`.

## Enumerations

> enum DrawableFormat

> enum_value DrawableFormat.DRAWABLE_FORMAT_RGBA8 = 0

OpenGL texture format RGBA with four components, each with a bitdepth of 8.

> enum_value DrawableFormat.DRAWABLE_FORMAT_RGBA8_SRGB = 1

OpenGL texture format RGBA with four components, each with a bitdepth of 8.
When drawn to, an sRGB to linear color space conversion is performed.

> enum_value DrawableFormat.DRAWABLE_FORMAT_RGBAH = 2

OpenGL texture format GL_RGBA16F where there are four components, each a 16-bit "half-precision" floating-point value.

> enum_value DrawableFormat.DRAWABLE_FORMAT_RGBAF = 3

OpenGL texture format GL_RGBA32F where there are four components, each a 32-bit floating-point value.
