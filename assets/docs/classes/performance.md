# Performance

> class Performance
> inherits Performance Object

## Brief

Exposes performance-related data.

## Description

This class provides access to a number of different monitors related to performance, such as memory usage, draw calls, and FPS. These are the same as the values displayed in the **Monitor** tab in the editor's **Debugger** panel. By using the `get_monitor` method of this class, you can access this data from your code.
You can add custom monitors using the `add_custom_monitor` method. Custom monitors are available in **Monitor** tab in the editor's **Debugger** panel together with built-in monitors.
**Note:** Some of the built-in monitors are only available in debug mode and will always return `0` when used in a project exported in release mode.
**Note:** Some of the built-in monitors are not updated in real-time for performance reasons, so there may be a delay of up to 1 second between changes.
**Note:** Custom monitors do not support negative values. Negative values are clamped to 0.

## Methods

> method add_custom_monitor(id: StringName, callable: Callable, arguments: Array = [], type: MonitorType = 0) -> void

Adds a custom monitor with the name `id`. You can specify the category of the monitor using slash delimiters in `id` (for example: `"Game/NumberOfNPCs"`). If there is more than one slash delimiter, then the default category is used. The default category is `"Custom"`. Prints an error if given `id` is already present.

```gdscript
                func _ready():
                    var monitor_value = Callable(self, "get_monitor_value")

                    # Adds monitor with name "MyName" to category "MyCategory".
                    Performance.add_custom_monitor("MyCategory/MyMonitor", monitor_value)

                    # Adds monitor with name "MyName" to category "Custom".
                    # Note: "MyCategory/MyMonitor" and "MyMonitor" have same name but different IDs, so the code is valid.
                    Performance.add_custom_monitor("MyMonitor", monitor_value)

                    # Adds monitor with name "MyName" to category "Custom".
                    # Note: "MyMonitor" and "Custom/MyMonitor" have same name and same category but different IDs, so the code is valid.
                    Performance.add_custom_monitor("Custom/MyMonitor", monitor_value)

                    # Adds monitor with name "MyCategoryOne/MyCategoryTwo/MyMonitor" to category "Custom".
                    Performance.add_custom_monitor("MyCategoryOne/MyCategoryTwo/MyMonitor", monitor_value)

                func get_monitor_value():
                    return randi() % 25

```

```csharp
                public override void _Ready()
                {
                    var monitorValue = new Callable(this, MethodName.GetMonitorValue);

                    // Adds monitor with name "MyName" to category "MyCategory".
                    Performance.AddCustomMonitor("MyCategory/MyMonitor", monitorValue);
                    // Adds monitor with name "MyName" to category "Custom".
                    // Note: "MyCategory/MyMonitor" and "MyMonitor" have same name but different ids so the code is valid.
                    Performance.AddCustomMonitor("MyMonitor", monitorValue);

                    // Adds monitor with name "MyName" to category "Custom".
                    // Note: "MyMonitor" and "Custom/MyMonitor" have same name and same category but different ids so the code is valid.
                    Performance.AddCustomMonitor("Custom/MyMonitor", monitorValue);

                    // Adds monitor with name "MyCategoryOne/MyCategoryTwo/MyMonitor" to category "Custom".
                    Performance.AddCustomMonitor("MyCategoryOne/MyCategoryTwo/MyMonitor", monitorValue);
                }

                public int GetMonitorValue()
                {
                    return GD.Randi() % 25;
                }

```

The debugger calls the callable to get the value of custom monitor. The callable must return a zero or positive integer or floating-point number.
Callables are called with arguments supplied in argument array.

> method get_custom_monitor(id: StringName) -> Variant

Returns the value of custom monitor with given `id`. The callable is called to get the value of custom monitor. See also `has_custom_monitor`. Prints an error if the given `id` is absent.

> method get_custom_monitor_names() -> Array[StringName]

Returns the names of active custom monitors in an `Array`.

> method get_custom_monitor_types() -> PackedInt32Array

Returns the `MonitorType` values of active custom monitors in an `Array`.

> method get_monitor(monitor: Monitor) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the value of one of the available built-in monitors. You should provide one of the `Monitor` constants as the argument, like this:

```gdscript
                print(Performance.get_monitor(Performance.TIME_FPS)) # Prints the FPS to the console.

```

```csharp
                GD.Print(Performance.GetMonitor(Performance.Monitor.TimeFps)); // Prints the FPS to the console.

```

See `get_custom_monitor` to query custom performance monitors' values.

> method get_monitor_modification_time() -> int

Returns the last tick in which custom monitor was added/removed (in microseconds since the engine started). This is set to `Time.get_ticks_usec` when the monitor is updated.

> method has_custom_monitor(id: StringName) -> bool

Returns `true` if custom monitor with the given `id` is present, `false` otherwise.

> method remove_custom_monitor(id: StringName) -> void

Removes the custom monitor with given `id`. Prints an error if the given `id` is already absent.

## Enumerations

> enum Monitor

> enum_value Monitor.TIME_FPS = 0

The number of frames rendered in the last second. This metric is only updated once per second, even if queried more often. *Higher is better.*

> enum_value Monitor.TIME_PROCESS = 1

Time it took to complete one frame, in seconds. *Lower is better.*

> enum_value Monitor.TIME_PHYSICS_PROCESS = 2

Time it took to complete one physics frame, in seconds. *Lower is better.*

> enum_value Monitor.TIME_NAVIGATION_PROCESS = 3

Time it took to complete one navigation step, in seconds. This includes navigation map updates as well as agent avoidance calculations. *Lower is better.*

> enum_value Monitor.MEMORY_STATIC = 4

Static memory currently used, in bytes. Not available in release builds. *Lower is better.*

> enum_value Monitor.MEMORY_STATIC_MAX = 5

Available static memory. Not available in release builds. *Lower is better.*

> enum_value Monitor.MEMORY_MESSAGE_BUFFER_MAX = 6

Largest amount of memory the message queue buffer has used, in bytes. The message queue is used for deferred functions calls and notifications. *Lower is better.*

> enum_value Monitor.OBJECT_COUNT = 7

Number of objects currently instantiated (including nodes). *Lower is better.*

> enum_value Monitor.OBJECT_RESOURCE_COUNT = 8

Number of resources currently used. *Lower is better.*

> enum_value Monitor.OBJECT_NODE_COUNT = 9

Number of nodes currently instantiated in the scene tree. This also includes the root node. *Lower is better.*

> enum_value Monitor.OBJECT_ORPHAN_NODE_COUNT = 10

Number of orphan nodes, i.e. nodes which are not parented to a node of the scene tree. *Lower is better.*
**Note:** This is only available in debug mode and will always return `0` when used in a project exported in release mode.

> enum_value Monitor.RENDER_TOTAL_OBJECTS_IN_FRAME = 11

> enum_value Monitor.RENDER_TOTAL_PRIMITIVES_IN_FRAME = 12

The total number of vertices or indices rendered in the last rendered frame. This metric doesn't include primitives from culled objects (either via hiding nodes, frustum culling or occlusion culling).

> enum_value Monitor.RENDER_TOTAL_DRAW_CALLS_IN_FRAME = 13

The total number of draw calls performed in the last rendered frame. This metric doesn't include culled objects (either via hiding nodes, frustum culling or occlusion culling), since they do not result in draw calls. *Lower is better.*

> enum_value Monitor.RENDER_VIDEO_MEM_USED = 14

The amount of video memory used (texture and vertex memory combined, in bytes). Since this metric also includes miscellaneous allocations, this value is always greater than the sum of `RENDER_TEXTURE_MEM_USED` and `RENDER_BUFFER_MEM_USED`. *Lower is better.*

> enum_value Monitor.RENDER_TEXTURE_MEM_USED = 15

The amount of texture memory used (in bytes). *Lower is better.*
