# Basis

> class Basis

## Brief

A 3×3 matrix for representing 3D rotation and scale.

## Description

The `Basis` built-in `Variant` type is a 3×3 [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)) used to represent 3D rotation, scale, and shear. It is frequently used within a `Transform3D`.
A `Basis` is composed by 3 axis vectors, each representing a column of the matrix: `x`, `y`, and `z`. The length of each axis (`Vector3.length`) influences the basis's scale, while the direction of all axes influence the rotation. Usually, these axes are perpendicular to one another. However, when you rotate any axis individually, the basis becomes sheared. Applying a sheared basis to a 3D model will make the model appear distorted.
A `Basis` is:
- **Orthogonal** if its axes are perpendicular to each other.
- **Normalized** if the length of every axis is `1.0`.
- **Uniform** if all axes share the same length (see `get_scale`).
- **Orthonormal** if it is both orthogonal and normalized, which allows it to only represent rotations (see `orthonormalized`).
- **Conformal** if it is both orthogonal and uniform, which ensures it is not distorted.
For a general introduction, see the [Matrices and transforms]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/math/matrices_and_transforms.html) tutorial.
**Note:** Godot uses a [right-handed coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule), which is a common standard. For directions, the convention for built-in types like `Camera3D` is for -Z to point forward (+X is right, +Y is up, and +Z is back). Other objects may use different direction conventions. For more information, see the [3D asset direction conventions]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/assets_pipeline/importing_3d_scenes/model_export_considerations.html#d-asset-direction-conventions) tutorial.
**Note:** The basis matrices are exposed as [column-major](https://www.mindcontrol.org/~hplus/graphics/matrix-layout.html) order, which is the same as OpenGL. However, they are stored internally in row-major order, which is the same as DirectX.
**Note:** In a boolean context, a basis will evaluate to `false` if it's equal to `IDENTITY`. Otherwise, a basis will always evaluate to `true`.

## Properties

> property x : Vector3 ; default=Vector3(1, 0, 0)

The basis's X axis, and the column `0` of the matrix.
On the identity basis, this vector points right (`Vector3.RIGHT`).

> property y : Vector3 ; default=Vector3(0, 1, 0)

The basis's Y axis, and the column `1` of the matrix.
On the identity basis, this vector points up (`Vector3.UP`).

> property z : Vector3 ; default=Vector3(0, 0, 1)

The basis's Z axis, and the column `2` of the matrix.
On the identity basis, this vector points back (`Vector3.BACK`).

## Constructors

> constructor Basis()

Constructs a `Basis` identical to `IDENTITY`.
**Note:** In C#, this constructs a `Basis` with all of its components set to `Vector3.ZERO`.

> constructor Basis(from: Basis)

Constructs a `Basis` as a copy of the given `Basis`.

> constructor Basis(axis: Vector3, angle: float)

Constructs a `Basis` that only represents rotation, rotated around the `axis` by the given `angle`, in radians. The axis must be a normalized vector.
**Note:** This is the same as using `rotated` on the `IDENTITY` basis. With more than one angle consider using `from_euler`, instead.

> constructor Basis(from: Quaternion)

Constructs a `Basis` that only represents rotation from the given `Quaternion`.
**Note:** Quaternions *only* store rotation, not scale. Because of this, conversions from `Basis` to `Quaternion` cannot always be reversed.

> constructor Basis(x_axis: Vector3, y_axis: Vector3, z_axis: Vector3)

Constructs a `Basis` from 3 axis vectors. These are the columns of the basis matrix.

## Methods

> method determinant() -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant) of this basis's matrix. For advanced math, this number can be used to determine a few attributes:
- If the determinant is exactly `0.0`, the basis is not invertible (see `inverse`).
- If the determinant is a negative number, the basis represents a negative scale.
**Note:** If the basis's scale is the same for every axis, its determinant is always that scale by the power of 3.

> method from_euler(euler: Vector3, order: int = 2) -> Basis ; qualifiers=static

Constructs a new `Basis` that only represents rotation from the given `Vector3` of [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles), in radians.
- The `Vector3.x` should contain the angle around the `x` axis (pitch);
- The `Vector3.y` should contain the angle around the `y` axis (yaw);
- The `Vector3.z` should contain the angle around the `z` axis (roll).

```gdscript
                # Creates a Basis whose z axis points down.
                var my_basis = Basis.from_euler(Vector3(TAU / 4, 0, 0))

                print(my_basis.z) # Prints (0.0, -1.0, 0.0)

```

```csharp
                // Creates a Basis whose z axis points down.
                var myBasis = Basis.FromEuler(new Vector3(Mathf.Tau / 4.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f));

                GD.Print(myBasis.Z); // Prints (0, -1, 0)

```

The order of each consecutive rotation can be changed with `order` (see `EulerOrder` constants). In Godot, Euler angles always use intrinsic order. By default, the intrinsic YXZ convention is used (`EULER_ORDER_YXZ`): the basis rotates first around the local Y axis (yaw), then local X (pitch), and lastly local Z (roll). When using the opposite method `get_euler` to decompose a rotation, this order is reversed.

> method from_scale(scale: Vector3) -> Basis ; qualifiers=static

Constructs a new `Basis` that only represents scale, with no rotation or shear, from the given `scale` vector.

```gdscript
                var my_basis = Basis.from_scale(Vector3(2, 4, 8))

                print(my_basis.x) # Prints (2.0, 0.0, 0.0)
                print(my_basis.y) # Prints (0.0, 4.0, 0.0)
                print(my_basis.z) # Prints (0.0, 0.0, 8.0)

```

```csharp
                var myBasis = Basis.FromScale(new Vector3(2.0f, 4.0f, 8.0f));

                GD.Print(myBasis.X); // Prints (2, 0, 0)
                GD.Print(myBasis.Y); // Prints (0, 4, 0)
                GD.Print(myBasis.Z); // Prints (0, 0, 8)

```

**Note:** In linear algebra, the matrix of this basis is also known as a [diagonal matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal_matrix).

> method get_euler(order: int = 2) -> Vector3 ; qualifiers=const

Returns this basis's rotation as a `Vector3` of [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles), in radians. For the returned value:
- The `Vector3.x` contains the angle around the `x` axis (pitch);
- The `Vector3.y` contains the angle around the `y` axis (yaw);
- The `Vector3.z` contains the angle around the `z` axis (roll).
The order of each consecutive rotation can be changed with `order` (see `EulerOrder` constants). In Godot, Euler angles always use intrinsic order. By default, the intrinsic YXZ convention is used (`EULER_ORDER_YXZ`): since we are decomposing, local Z (roll) is calculated first, then local X (pitch), and lastly local Y (yaw). When using the opposite method `from_euler` to compose a rotation, this order is reversed.
**Note:** For this method to return correctly, the basis needs to be *orthonormal* (see `orthonormalized`).
**Note:** Euler angles are much more intuitive but are not suitable for 3D math. Because of this, consider using the `get_rotation_quaternion` method instead, which returns a `Quaternion`.
**Note:** In the Inspector dock, a basis's rotation is often displayed in Euler angles (in degrees), as is the case with the `Node3D.rotation` property.

> method get_rotation_quaternion() -> Quaternion ; qualifiers=const

Returns this basis's rotation as a `Quaternion`.
**Note:** Quaternions are much more suitable for 3D math but are less intuitive. For user interfaces, consider using the `get_euler` method, which returns Euler angles.

> method get_scale() -> Vector3 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the length of each axis of this basis, as a `Vector3`. If the basis is not sheared, this value is the scaling factor. It is not affected by rotation.

```gdscript
                var my_basis = Basis(
                    Vector3(2, 0, 0),
                    Vector3(0, 4, 0),
                    Vector3(0, 0, 8)
                )
                # Rotating the Basis in any way preserves its scale.
                my_basis = my_basis.rotated(Vector3.UP, TAU / 2)
                my_basis = my_basis.rotated(Vector3.RIGHT, TAU / 4)

                print(my_basis.get_scale()) # Prints (2.0, 4.0, 8.0)

```

```csharp
                var myBasis = new Basis(
                    Vector3(2.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f),
                    Vector3(0.0f, 4.0f, 0.0f),
                    Vector3(0.0f, 0.0f, 8.0f)
                );
                // Rotating the Basis in any way preserves its scale.
                myBasis = myBasis.Rotated(Vector3.Up, Mathf.Tau / 2.0f);
                myBasis = myBasis.Rotated(Vector3.Right, Mathf.Tau / 4.0f);

                GD.Print(myBasis.Scale); // Prints (2, 4, 8)

```

**Note:** If the value returned by `determinant` is negative, the scale is also negative.

> method inverse() -> Basis ; qualifiers=const

Returns the [inverse of this basis's matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix).

> method is_conformal() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this basis is conformal. A conformal basis is both *orthogonal* (the axes are perpendicular to each other) and *uniform* (the axes share the same length). This method can be especially useful during physics calculations.

> method is_equal_approx(b: Basis) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this basis and `b` are approximately equal, by calling `@GlobalScope.is_equal_approx` on all vector components.

> method is_finite() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this basis is finite, by calling `@GlobalScope.is_finite` on all vector components.

> method is_orthonormal() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this basis is orthonormal. An orthonormal basis is both *orthogonal* (the axes are perpendicular to each other) and *normalized* (the length of every axis is `1.0`). This method can be especially useful during physics calculations.

> method looking_at(target: Vector3, up: Vector3 = Vector3(0, 1, 0), use_model_front: bool = false) -> Basis ; qualifiers=static

Creates a new `Basis` with a rotation such that the forward axis (-Z) points towards the `target` position.
By default, the -Z axis (camera forward) is treated as forward (implies +X is right). If `use_model_front` is `true`, the +Z axis (asset front) is treated as forward (implies +X is left) and points toward the `target` position.
The up axis (+Y) points as close to the `up` vector as possible while staying perpendicular to the forward axis. The returned basis is orthonormalized (see `orthonormalized`).
The `target` and the `up` cannot be `Vector3.ZERO`, and shouldn't be colinear to avoid unintended rotation around local Z axis.

> method orthonormalized() -> Basis ; qualifiers=const

Returns the orthonormalized version of this basis. An orthonormal basis is both *orthogonal* (the axes are perpendicular to each other) and *normalized* (the axes have a length of `1.0`), which also means it can only represent a rotation.
It is often useful to call this method to avoid rounding errors on a rotating basis:

```gdscript
                # Rotate this Node3D every frame.
                func _process(delta):
                    basis = basis.rotated(Vector3.UP, TAU * delta)
                    basis = basis.rotated(Vector3.RIGHT, TAU * delta)
                    basis = basis.orthonormalized()

```

```csharp
                // Rotate this Node3D every frame.
                public override void _Process(double delta)
                {
                    Basis = Basis.Rotated(Vector3.Up, Mathf.Tau * (float)delta)
                            .Rotated(Vector3.Right, Mathf.Tau * (float)delta)
                            .Orthonormalized();
                }

```

> method rotated(axis: Vector3, angle: float) -> Basis ; qualifiers=const

Returns a copy of this basis rotated around the given `axis` by the given `angle` (in radians).
The `axis` must be a normalized vector (see `Vector3.normalized`). If `angle` is positive, the basis is rotated counter-clockwise around the axis.

```gdscript
                var my_basis = Basis.IDENTITY
                var angle = TAU / 2

                my_basis = my_basis.rotated(Vector3.UP, angle)    # Rotate around the up axis (yaw).
                my_basis = my_basis.rotated(Vector3.RIGHT, angle) # Rotate around the right axis (pitch).
                my_basis = my_basis.rotated(Vector3.BACK, angle)  # Rotate around the back axis (roll).

```

```csharp
                var myBasis = Basis.Identity;
                var angle = Mathf.Tau / 2.0f;

                myBasis = myBasis.Rotated(Vector3.Up, angle);    // Rotate around the up axis (yaw).
                myBasis = myBasis.Rotated(Vector3.Right, angle); // Rotate around the right axis (pitch).
                myBasis = myBasis.Rotated(Vector3.Back, angle);  // Rotate around the back axis (roll).

```

> method scaled(scale: Vector3) -> Basis ; qualifiers=const

Returns this basis with each axis's components scaled by the given `scale`'s components.
The basis matrix's rows are multiplied by `scale`'s components. This operation is a global scale (relative to the parent).

```gdscript
                var my_basis = Basis(
                    Vector3(1, 1, 1),
                    Vector3(2, 2, 2),
                    Vector3(3, 3, 3)
                )
                my_basis = my_basis.scaled(Vector3(0, 2, -2))

                print(my_basis.x) # Prints (0.0, 2.0, -2.0)
                print(my_basis.y) # Prints (0.0, 4.0, -4.0)
                print(my_basis.z) # Prints (0.0, 6.0, -6.0)

```

```csharp
                var myBasis = new Basis(
                    new Vector3(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f),
                    new Vector3(2.0f, 2.0f, 2.0f),
                    new Vector3(3.0f, 3.0f, 3.0f)
                );
                myBasis = myBasis.Scaled(new Vector3(0.0f, 2.0f, -2.0f));

                GD.Print(myBasis.X); // Prints (0, 2, -2)
                GD.Print(myBasis.Y); // Prints (0, 4, -4)
                GD.Print(myBasis.Z); // Prints (0, 6, -6)

```

> method scaled_local(scale: Vector3) -> Basis ; qualifiers=const

Returns this basis with each axis scaled by the corresponding component in the given `scale`.
The basis matrix's columns are multiplied by `scale`'s components. This operation is a local scale (relative to self).

```gdscript
                var my_basis = Basis(
                    Vector3(1, 1, 1),
                    Vector3(2, 2, 2),
                    Vector3(3, 3, 3)
                )
                my_basis = my_basis.scaled_local(Vector3(0, 2, -2))

                print(my_basis.x) # Prints (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
                print(my_basis.y) # Prints (4.0, 4.0, 4.0)
                print(my_basis.z) # Prints (-6.0, -6.0, -6.0)

```

```csharp
                var myBasis = new Basis(
                    new Vector3(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f),
                    new Vector3(2.0f, 2.0f, 2.0f),
                    new Vector3(3.0f, 3.0f, 3.0f)
                );
                myBasis = myBasis.ScaledLocal(new Vector3(0.0f, 2.0f, -2.0f));

                GD.Print(myBasis.X); // Prints (0, 0, 0)
                GD.Print(myBasis.Y); // Prints (4, 4, 4)
                GD.Print(myBasis.Z); // Prints (-6, -6, -6)

```

> method slerp(to: Basis, weight: float) -> Basis ; qualifiers=const

Performs a spherical-linear interpolation with the `to` basis, given a `weight`. Both this basis and `to` should represent a rotation.
**Example:** Smoothly rotate a `Node3D` to the target basis over time, with a `Tween`:

```text
                var start_basis = Basis.IDENTITY
                var target_basis = Basis.IDENTITY.rotated(Vector3.UP, TAU / 2)

                func _ready():
                    create_tween().tween_method(interpolate, 0.0, 1.0, 5.0).set_trans(Tween.TRANS_EXPO)

                func interpolate(weight):
                    basis = start_basis.slerp(target_basis, weight)

```

> method tdotx(with: Vector3) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the transposed dot product between `with` and the `x` axis (see `transposed`).
This is equivalent to `basis.x.dot(vector)`.

> method tdoty(with: Vector3) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the transposed dot product between `with` and the `y` axis (see `transposed`).
This is equivalent to `basis.y.dot(vector)`.

> method tdotz(with: Vector3) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the transposed dot product between `with` and the `z` axis (see `transposed`).
This is equivalent to `basis.z.dot(vector)`.

> method transposed() -> Basis ; qualifiers=const

Returns the transposed version of this basis. This turns the basis matrix's columns into rows, and its rows into columns.

```gdscript
                var my_basis = Basis(
                    Vector3(1, 2, 3),
                    Vector3(4, 5, 6),
                    Vector3(7, 8, 9)
                )
                my_basis = my_basis.transposed()

                print(my_basis.x) # Prints (1.0, 4.0, 7.0)
                print(my_basis.y) # Prints (2.0, 5.0, 8.0)
                print(my_basis.z) # Prints (3.0, 6.0, 9.0)

```

```csharp
                var myBasis = new Basis(
                    new Vector3(1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f),
                    new Vector3(4.0f, 5.0f, 6.0f),
                    new Vector3(7.0f, 8.0f, 9.0f)
                );
                myBasis = myBasis.Transposed();

                GD.Print(myBasis.X); // Prints (1, 4, 7)
                GD.Print(myBasis.Y); // Prints (2, 5, 8)
                GD.Print(myBasis.Z); // Prints (3, 6, 9)

```

## Operators

> operator !=(right: Basis) -> bool

Returns `true` if the components of both `Basis` matrices are not equal.
**Note:** Due to floating-point precision errors, consider using `is_equal_approx` instead, which is more reliable.

> operator *(right: Basis) -> Basis

Transforms (multiplies) the `right` basis by this basis.
This is the operation performed between parent and child `Node3D`s.

> operator *(right: Vector3) -> Vector3

Transforms (multiplies) the `right` vector by this basis, returning a `Vector3`.

```gdscript
                # Basis that swaps the X/Z axes and doubles the scale.
                var my_basis = Basis(Vector3(0, 2, 0), Vector3(2, 0, 0), Vector3(0, 0, 2))
                print(my_basis * Vector3(1, 2, 3)) # Prints (4.0, 2.0, 6.0)

```

```csharp
                // Basis that swaps the X/Z axes and doubles the scale.
                var myBasis = new Basis(new Vector3(0, 2, 0), new Vector3(2, 0, 0), new Vector3(0, 0, 2));
                GD.Print(myBasis * new Vector3(1, 2, 3)); // Prints (4, 2, 6)

```

> operator *(right: float) -> Basis

Multiplies all components of the `Basis` by the given `float`. This affects the basis's scale uniformly, resizing all 3 axes by the `right` value.

> operator *(right: int) -> Basis

Multiplies all components of the `Basis` by the given `int`. This affects the basis's scale uniformly, resizing all 3 axes by the `right` value.

> operator /(right: float) -> Basis

Divides all components of the `Basis` by the given `float`. This affects the basis's scale uniformly, resizing all 3 axes by the `right` value.

> operator /(right: int) -> Basis

Divides all components of the `Basis` by the given `int`. This affects the basis's scale uniformly, resizing all 3 axes by the `right` value.

> operator ==(right: Basis) -> bool

Returns `true` if the components of both `Basis` matrices are exactly equal.
**Note:** Due to floating-point precision errors, consider using `is_equal_approx` instead, which is more reliable.

> operator [](index: int) -> Vector3

Accesses each axis (column) of this basis by their index. Index `0` is the same as `x`, index `1` is the same as `y`, and index `2` is the same as `z`.
**Note:** In C++, this operator accesses the rows of the basis matrix, *not* the columns. For the same behavior as scripting languages, use the `set_column` and `get_column` methods.

## Constants

> constant IDENTITY = Basis(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1)

The identity `Basis`. This is an orthonormal basis with no rotation, no shear, and a scale of `Vector3.ONE`. This also means that:
- The `x` points right (`Vector3.RIGHT`);
- The `y` points up (`Vector3.UP`);
- The `z` points back (`Vector3.BACK`).

```text
            var basis = Basis.IDENTITY

If a `Vector3` or another `Basis` is transformed (multiplied) by this constant, no transformation occurs.
**Note:** In GDScript, this constant is equivalent to creating a `Basis` without any arguments. It can be used to make your code clearer, and for consistency with C#.

> constant FLIP_X = Basis(-1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1)

When any basis is multiplied by `FLIP_X`, it negates all components of the `x` axis (the X column).
When `FLIP_X` is multiplied by any basis, it negates the `Vector3.x` component of all axes (the X row).

> constant FLIP_Y = Basis(1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 1)

When any basis is multiplied by `FLIP_Y`, it negates all components of the `y` axis (the Y column).
When `FLIP_Y` is multiplied by any basis, it negates the `Vector3.y` component of all axes (the Y row).

> constant FLIP_Z = Basis(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1)

When any basis is multiplied by `FLIP_Z`, it negates all components of the `z` axis (the Z column).
When `FLIP_Z` is multiplied by any basis, it negates the `Vector3.z` component of all axes (the Z row).
