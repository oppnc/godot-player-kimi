# NavigationServer3DManager

> class NavigationServer3DManager
> inherits NavigationServer3DManager Object

## Brief

A singleton for managing `NavigationServer3D` implementations.

## Description

`NavigationServer3DManager` is the API for registering `NavigationServer3D` implementations and setting the default implementation.
**Note:** It is not possible to switch servers at runtime. This class is only used on startup at the server initialization level.

## Methods

> method register_server(name: String, create_callback: Callable) -> void

Registers a `NavigationServer3D` implementation by passing a `name` and a `Callable` that returns a `NavigationServer3D` object.

> method set_default_server(name: String, priority: int) -> void

Sets the default `NavigationServer3D` implementation to the one identified by `name`, if `priority` is greater than the priority of the current default implementation.
