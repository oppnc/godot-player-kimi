# OptimizedTranslation

> class OptimizedTranslation
> inherits OptimizedTranslation Translation

## Brief

An optimized translation.

## Description

An optimized translation. Uses real-time compressed translations, which results in very small dictionaries.
This class does not store the untranslated strings for optimization purposes. Therefore, `Translation.get_message_list` always returns an empty array, and `Translation.get_message_count` always returns `0`.

## Methods

> method generate(from: Translation) -> bool

Generates and sets an optimized translation from the given `Translation` resource. Returns `true` if successful.
**Note:** Messages in `from` should not use context or plural forms.
**Note:** This method is intended to be used in the editor. It does nothing when called from an exported project.
