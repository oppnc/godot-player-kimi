# Vector2

> class Vector2

## Brief

A 2D vector using floating-point coordinates.

## Description

A 2-element structure that can be used to represent 2D coordinates or any other pair of numeric values.
It uses floating-point coordinates. By default, these floating-point values use 32-bit precision, unlike `float` which is always 64-bit. If double precision is needed, compile the engine with the option `precision=double`.
See `Vector2i` for its integer counterpart.
**Note:** In a boolean context, a Vector2 will evaluate to `false` if it's equal to `Vector2(0, 0)`. Otherwise, a Vector2 will always evaluate to `true`.

## Properties

> property x : float ; default=0.0

The vector's X component. Also accessible by using the index position `[0]`.

> property y : float ; default=0.0

The vector's Y component. Also accessible by using the index position `[1]`.

## Constructors

> constructor Vector2()

Constructs a default-initialized `Vector2` with all components set to `0`.

> constructor Vector2(from: Vector2)

Constructs a `Vector2` as a copy of the given `Vector2`.

> constructor Vector2(from: Vector2i)

Constructs a new `Vector2` from `Vector2i`.

> constructor Vector2(x: float, y: float)

Constructs a new `Vector2` from the given `x` and `y`.

## Methods

> method abs() -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new vector with all components in absolute values (i.e. positive).

> method angle() -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns this vector's angle with respect to the positive X axis, or `(1, 0)` vector, in radians.
For example, `Vector2.RIGHT.angle()` will return zero, `Vector2.DOWN.angle()` will return `PI / 2` (a quarter turn, or 90 degrees), and `Vector2(1, -1).angle()` will return `-PI / 4` (a negative eighth turn, or -45 degrees).
This is equivalent to calling `@GlobalScope.atan2` with `y` and `x`.

> method aspect() -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns this vector's aspect ratio, which is `x` divided by `y`.

> method bezier_derivative(control_1: Vector2, control_2: Vector2, end: Vector2, t: float) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the derivative at the given `t` on the [Bézier curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve) defined by this vector and the given `control_1`, `control_2`, and `end` points.

> method bezier_interpolate(control_1: Vector2, control_2: Vector2, end: Vector2, t: float) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the point at the given `t` on the [Bézier curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve) defined by this vector and the given `control_1`, `control_2`, and `end` points.

> method bounce(n: Vector2) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the vector "bounced off" from a line defined by the given normal `n` perpendicular to the line.
**Note:** `bounce` performs the operation that most engines and frameworks call `reflect()`.

> method ceil() -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new vector with all components rounded up (towards positive infinity).

> method clamp(min: Vector2, max: Vector2) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new vector with all components clamped between the components of `min` and `max`, by running `@GlobalScope.clamp` on each component.

> method clampf(min: float, max: float) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new vector with all components clamped between `min` and `max`, by running `@GlobalScope.clamp` on each component.

> method cross(with: Vector2) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the 2D analog of the cross product for this vector and `with`.
This is the signed area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors. If the second vector is clockwise from the first vector, then the cross product is the positive area. If counter-clockwise, the cross product is the negative area. If the two vectors are parallel this returns zero, making it useful for testing if two vectors are parallel.
**Note:** Cross product is not defined in 2D mathematically. This method embeds the 2D vectors in the XY plane of 3D space and uses their cross product's Z component as the analog.

> method cubic_interpolate(b: Vector2, pre_a: Vector2, post_b: Vector2, weight: float) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Performs a cubic interpolation between this vector and `b` using `pre_a` and `post_b` as handles, and returns the result at position `weight`. `weight` is on the range of 0.0 to 1.0, representing the amount of interpolation.

> method cubic_interpolate_in_time(b: Vector2, pre_a: Vector2, post_b: Vector2, weight: float, b_t: float, pre_a_t: float, post_b_t: float) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Performs a cubic interpolation between this vector and `b` using `pre_a` and `post_b` as handles, and returns the result at position `weight`. `weight` is on the range of 0.0 to 1.0, representing the amount of interpolation.
It can perform smoother interpolation than `cubic_interpolate` by the time values.

> method direction_to(to: Vector2) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the normalized vector pointing from this vector to `to`.
`a.direction_to(b)` is equivalent to `(b - a).normalized()`. See also `normalized`.

> method distance_squared_to(to: Vector2) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the squared [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) between this vector and `to`.
This method runs faster than `distance_to`, so prefer it if you need to compare vectors or need the squared distance for some formula.

> method distance_to(to: Vector2) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) between this vector and `to`.

> method dot(with: Vector2) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the dot product of this vector and `with`. This can be used to compare the angle between two vectors. For example, this can be used to determine whether an enemy is facing the player.
The dot product will be `0` for a right angle (90 degrees), greater than 0 for angles narrower than 90 degrees and lower than 0 for angles wider than 90 degrees.
When using unit (normalized) vectors, the result will always be between `-1.0` (180 degree angle) when the vectors are facing opposite directions, and `1.0` (0 degree angle) when the vectors are aligned.
**Note:** `a.dot(b)` is equivalent to `b.dot(a)`.

> method floor() -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new vector with all components rounded down (towards negative infinity).

> method from_angle(angle: float) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=static

Creates a `Vector2` rotated to the given `angle` in radians. This is equivalent to doing `Vector2(cos(angle), sin(angle))` or `Vector2.RIGHT.rotated(angle)`.

```text
                print(Vector2.from_angle(0)) # Prints (1.0, 0.0)
                print(Vector2(1, 0).angle()) # Prints 0.0, which is the angle used above.
                print(Vector2.from_angle(PI / 2)) # Prints (0.0, 1.0)

```

**Note:** The length of the returned `Vector2` is *approximately* `1.0`, but is is not guaranteed to be exactly `1.0` due to floating-point precision issues. Call `normalized` on the returned `Vector2` if you require a unit vector.

> method is_equal_approx(to: Vector2) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this vector and `to` are approximately equal, by running `@GlobalScope.is_equal_approx` on each component.

> method is_finite() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this vector is finite, by calling `@GlobalScope.is_finite` on each component.

> method is_normalized() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the vector is normalized, i.e. its length is approximately equal to 1.

> method is_zero_approx() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this vector's values are approximately zero, by running `@GlobalScope.is_zero_approx` on each component.
This method is faster than using `is_equal_approx` with one value as a zero vector.

> method length() -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the length (magnitude) of this vector.

> method length_squared() -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the squared length (squared magnitude) of this vector.
This method runs faster than `length`, so prefer it if you need to compare vectors or need the squared distance for some formula.

> method lerp(to: Vector2, weight: float) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the result of the linear interpolation between this vector and `to` by amount `weight`. `weight` is on the range of `0.0` to `1.0`, representing the amount of interpolation.

> method limit_length(length: float = 1.0) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

> method max(with: Vector2) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the component-wise maximum of this and `with`, equivalent to `Vector2(maxf(x, with.x), maxf(y, with.y))`.

> method max_axis_index() -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the axis of the vector's highest value. See `AXIS_*` constants. If all components are equal, this method returns `AXIS_X`.

> method maxf(with: float) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the component-wise maximum of this and `with`, equivalent to `Vector2(maxf(x, with), maxf(y, with))`.

> method min(with: Vector2) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

> method move_toward(to: Vector2, delta: float) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new vector moved toward `to` by the fixed `delta` amount. Will not go past the final value.

> method normalized() -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the result of scaling the vector to unit length. Equivalent to `v / v.length()`. Returns `(0, 0)` if `v.length() == 0`. See also `is_normalized`.
**Note:** This function may return incorrect values if the input vector length is near zero.

> method posmod(mod: float) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns a vector composed of the `@GlobalScope.fposmod` of this vector's components and `mod`.

> method posmodv(modv: Vector2) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns a vector composed of the `@GlobalScope.fposmod` of this vector's components and `modv`'s components.

> method project(b: Vector2) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new vector resulting from projecting this vector onto the given vector `b`. The resulting new vector is parallel to `b`. See also `slide`.
**Note:** If the vector `b` is a zero vector, the components of the resulting new vector will be `@GDScript.NAN`.

> method reflect(line: Vector2) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the result of reflecting the vector from a line defined by the given direction vector `line`.
**Note:** `reflect` differs from what other engines and frameworks call `reflect()`. In other engines, `reflect()` takes a normal direction which is a direction perpendicular to the line. In Godot, you specify the direction of the line directly. See also `bounce` which does what most engines call `reflect()`.

> method rotated(angle: float) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the result of rotating this vector by `angle` (in radians). See also `@GlobalScope.deg_to_rad`.

> method round() -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new vector with all components rounded to the nearest integer, with halfway cases rounded away from zero.

> method sign() -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new vector with each component set to `1.0` if it's positive, `-1.0` if it's negative, and `0.0` if it's zero. The result is identical to calling `@GlobalScope.sign` on each component.

> method slerp(to: Vector2, weight: float) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the result of spherical linear interpolation between this vector and `to`, by amount `weight`. `weight` is on the range of 0.0 to 1.0, representing the amount of interpolation.
This method also handles interpolating the lengths if the input vectors have different lengths. For the special case of one or both input vectors having zero length, this method behaves like `lerp`.

> method slide(n: Vector2) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new vector resulting from sliding this vector along a line with normal `n`. The resulting new vector is perpendicular to `n`, and is equivalent to this vector minus its projection on `n`. See also `project`.
**Note:** The vector `n` must be normalized. See also `normalized`.

> method snapped(step: Vector2) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new vector with each component snapped to the nearest multiple of the corresponding component in `step`. This can also be used to round the components to an arbitrary number of decimals.

> method snappedf(step: float) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new vector with each component snapped to the nearest multiple of `step`. This can also be used to round the components to an arbitrary number of decimals.

## Operators

> operator !=(right: Vector2) -> bool

Returns `true` if the vectors are not equal.
**Note:** Due to floating-point precision errors, consider using `is_equal_approx` instead, which is more reliable.
**Note:** Vectors with `@GDScript.NAN` elements don't behave the same as other vectors. Therefore, the results from this operator may not be accurate if NaNs are included.

> operator *(right: Transform2D) -> Vector2

Inversely transforms (multiplies) the `Vector2` by the given `Transform2D` transformation matrix, under the assumption that the transformation basis is orthonormal (i.e. rotation/reflection is fine, scaling/skew is not).
`vector * transform` is equivalent to `transform.inverse() * vector`. See `Transform2D.inverse`.
For transforming by inverse of an affine transformation (e.g. with scaling) `transform.affine_inverse() * vector` can be used instead. See `Transform2D.affine_inverse`.

                print(Vector2(10, 20) * Vector2(3, 4)) # Prints (30.0, 80.0)

```

Adds each component of the `Vector2` by the components of the given `Vector2`.

```text
                print(Vector2(10, 20) + Vector2(3, 4)) # Prints (13.0, 24.0)

```

> operator -(right: Vector2) -> Vector2

```

> operator /(right: Vector2) -> Vector2

```text
                print(Vector2(10, 20) / Vector2(2, 5)) # Prints (5.0, 4.0)

```

Divides each component of the `Vector2` by the given `float`.

> operator /(right: int) -> Vector2

Divides each component of the `Vector2` by the given `int`.

> operator <(right: Vector2) -> bool

Compares two `Vector2` vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is less than the X value of the `right` vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.
**Note:** Vectors with `@GDScript.NAN` elements don't behave the same as other vectors. Therefore, the results from this operator may not be accurate if NaNs are included.

> operator <=(right: Vector2) -> bool

Compares two `Vector2` vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is less than or equal to the X value of the `right` vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.
**Note:** Vectors with `@GDScript.NAN` elements don't behave the same as other vectors. Therefore, the results from this operator may not be accurate if NaNs are included.

> operator ==(right: Vector2) -> bool

Returns `true` if the vectors are exactly equal.
**Note:** Due to floating-point precision errors, consider using `is_equal_approx` instead, which is more reliable.
**Note:** Vectors with `@GDScript.NAN` elements don't behave the same as other vectors. Therefore, the results from this operator may not be accurate if NaNs are included.

> operator >(right: Vector2) -> bool

Compares two `Vector2` vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is greater than the X value of the `right` vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.
**Note:** Vectors with `@GDScript.NAN` elements don't behave the same as other vectors. Therefore, the results from this operator may not be accurate if NaNs are included.

> operator >=(right: Vector2) -> bool

Compares two `Vector2` vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is greater than or equal to the X value of the `right` vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.
**Note:** Vectors with `@GDScript.NAN` elements don't behave the same as other vectors. Therefore, the results from this operator may not be accurate if NaNs are included.

> operator [](index: int) -> float

Access vector components using their `index`. `v[0]` is equivalent to `v.x`, and `v[1]` is equivalent to `v.y`.

> operator unary+() -> Vector2

Returns the same value as if the `+` was not there. Unary `+` does nothing, but sometimes it can make your code more readable.

> operator unary-() -> Vector2

Returns the negative value of the `Vector2`. This is the same as writing `Vector2(-v.x, -v.y)`. This operation flips the direction of the vector while keeping the same magnitude. With floats, the number zero can be either positive or negative.
