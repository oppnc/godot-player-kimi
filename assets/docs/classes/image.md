# Image

> class Image
> inherits Image Resource

## Brief

Image datatype.

## Description

Native image datatype. Contains image data which can be converted to an `ImageTexture` and provides commonly used *image processing* methods. The maximum width and height for an `Image` are `MAX_WIDTH` and `MAX_HEIGHT`.
An `Image` cannot be assigned to a texture property of an object directly (such as `Sprite2D.texture`), and has to be converted manually to an `ImageTexture` first.
**Note:** Methods that modify the image data cannot be used on VRAM-compressed images. Use `decompress` to convert the image to an uncompressed format first.
**Note:** The maximum image size is 16384×16384 pixels due to graphics hardware limitations. Larger images may fail to import.

## Properties

> property data : Dictionary ; default={ "data": PackedByteArray(), "format": "Lum8", "height": 0, "mipmaps": false, "width": 0 } ; setter=_set_data ; getter=_get_data

Holds all the image's color data in a given format. See `Format` constants.

## Methods

> method adjust_bcs(brightness: float, contrast: float, saturation: float) -> void

Adjusts this image's `brightness`, `contrast`, and `saturation` by the given values. Does not work if the image is compressed (see `is_compressed`).

> method blend_rect(src: Image, src_rect: Rect2i, dst: Vector2i) -> void

Alpha-blends `src_rect` from `src` image to this image at coordinates `dst`, clipped accordingly to both image bounds. This image and `src` image **must** have the same format. `src_rect` with non-positive size is treated as empty.

> method blend_rect_mask(src: Image, mask: Image, src_rect: Rect2i, dst: Vector2i) -> void

Alpha-blends `src_rect` from `src` image to this image using `mask` image at coordinates `dst`, clipped accordingly to both image bounds. Alpha channels are required for both `src` and `mask`. `dst` pixels and `src` pixels will blend if the corresponding mask pixel's alpha value is not 0. This image and `src` image **must** have the same format. `src` image and `mask` image **must** have the same size (width and height) but they can have different formats. `src_rect` with non-positive size is treated as empty.

> method blit_rect(src: Image, src_rect: Rect2i, dst: Vector2i) -> void

Copies `src_rect` from `src` image to this image at coordinates `dst`, clipped accordingly to both image bounds. This image and `src` image **must** have the same format. `src_rect` with non-positive size is treated as empty.
**Note:** The alpha channel data in `src` will overwrite the corresponding data in this image at the target position. To blend alpha channels, use `blend_rect` instead.

> method blit_rect_mask(src: Image, mask: Image, src_rect: Rect2i, dst: Vector2i) -> void

Blits `src_rect` area from `src` image to this image at the coordinates given by `dst`, clipped accordingly to both image bounds. `src` pixel is copied onto `dst` if the corresponding `mask` pixel's alpha value is not 0. This image and `src` image **must** have the same format. `src` image and `mask` image **must** have the same size (width and height) but they can have different formats. `src_rect` with non-positive size is treated as empty.

> method bump_map_to_normal_map(bump_scale: float = 1.0) -> void

Converts a bump map to a normal map. A bump map provides a height offset per-pixel, while a normal map provides a normal direction per pixel.

> method clear_mipmaps() -> void

Removes the image's mipmaps.

> method compress(mode: CompressMode, source: CompressSource = 0, astc_format: ASTCFormat = 0) -> Error

Compresses the image with a VRAM-compressed format to use less memory. Can not directly access pixel data while the image is compressed. Returns error if the chosen compression mode is not available.
The `source` parameter helps to pick the best compression method for DXT and ETC2 formats. It is ignored for ASTC compression.
The `astc_format` parameter is only taken into account when using ASTC compression; it is ignored for all other formats.
**Note:** `compress` is only supported in editor builds. When run in an exported project, this method always returns `ERR_UNAVAILABLE`.

> method compress_from_channels(mode: CompressMode, channels: UsedChannels, astc_format: ASTCFormat = 0) -> Error

Compresses the image with a VRAM-compressed format to use less memory. Can not directly access pixel data while the image is compressed. Returns error if the chosen compression mode is not available.
This is an alternative to `compress` that lets the user supply the channels used in order for the compressor to pick the best DXT and ETC2 formats. For other formats (non DXT or ETC2), this argument is ignored.
The `astc_format` parameter is only taken into account when using ASTC compression; it is ignored for all other formats.
**Note:** `compress_from_channels` is only supported in editor builds. When run in an exported project, this method always returns `ERR_UNAVAILABLE`.

> method compute_image_metrics(compared_image: Image, use_luma: bool) -> Dictionary

Compute image metrics on the current image and the compared image. This can be used to calculate the similarity between two images.
The dictionary contains `max`, `mean`, `mean_squared`, `root_mean_squared` and `peak_snr`.

> method convert(format: Format) -> void

Converts this image's format to the given `format`.

> method copy_from(src: Image) -> void

Copies `src` image to this image.

> method create(width: int, height: int, use_mipmaps: bool, format: Format) -> Image ; qualifiers=static ; deprecated=Use `create_empty`.

Creates an empty image of the given size and format. If `use_mipmaps` is `true`, generates mipmaps for this image (see `generate_mipmaps`).

> method create_empty(width: int, height: int, use_mipmaps: bool, format: Format) -> Image ; qualifiers=static

Creates an empty image of the given size and format. If `use_mipmaps` is `true`, generates mipmaps for this image (see `generate_mipmaps`).

> method create_from_data(width: int, height: int, use_mipmaps: bool, format: Format, data: PackedByteArray) -> Image ; qualifiers=static

Creates a new image of the given size and format. Fills the image with the given raw data. If `use_mipmaps` is `true`, loads the mipmaps for this image from `data`. See `generate_mipmaps`.

> method crop(width: int, height: int) -> void

Crops the image to the given `width` and `height`. If the specified size is larger than the current size, the extra area is filled with black pixels.

> method decompress() -> Error

Decompresses the image if it is VRAM-compressed in a supported format. This increases memory utilization, but allows modifying the image. Returns `OK` if the format is supported, otherwise `ERR_UNAVAILABLE`. All VRAM-compressed formats supported by Godot can be decompressed with this method, except `FORMAT_ETC2_R11S`, `FORMAT_ETC2_RG11S`, and `FORMAT_ETC2_RGB8A1`.

> method detect_alpha() -> AlphaMode ; qualifiers=const

Returns `ALPHA_BLEND` if the image has data for alpha values. Returns `ALPHA_BIT` if all the alpha values are stored in a single bit. Returns `ALPHA_NONE` if no data for alpha values is found.

> method detect_used_channels(source: CompressSource = 0) -> UsedChannels ; qualifiers=const

Returns the color channels used by this image. If the image is compressed, the original `source` must be specified.

> method fill(color: Color) -> void

Fills the image with `color`.

> method fill_rect(rect: Rect2i, color: Color) -> void

Fills `rect` with `color`.

> method fix_alpha_edges() -> void

Blends low-alpha pixels with nearby pixels.

> method flip_x() -> void

Flips the image horizontally.

> method flip_y() -> void

Flips the image vertically.

> method generate_mipmaps(renormalize: bool = false) -> Error

Generates mipmaps for the image. Mipmaps are precalculated lower-resolution copies of the image that are automatically used if the image needs to be scaled down when rendered. They help improve image quality and performance when rendering. This method returns an error if the image is compressed, in a custom format, or if the image's width/height is `0`. Enabling `renormalize` when generating mipmaps for normal map textures will make sure all resulting vector values are normalized.
It is possible to check if the image has mipmaps by calling `has_mipmaps` or `get_mipmap_count`. Calling `generate_mipmaps` on an image that already has mipmaps will replace existing mipmaps in the image.

> method get_data() -> PackedByteArray ; qualifiers=const

Returns a copy of the image's raw data.

> method get_data_size() -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns size (in bytes) of the image's raw data.

> method get_format() -> Format ; qualifiers=const

Returns this image's format.

> method get_height() -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the image's height.

> method get_mipmap_count() -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the number of mipmap levels or 0 if the image has no mipmaps. The largest main level image is not counted as a mipmap level by this method, so if you want to include it you can add 1 to this count.

> method get_mipmap_offset(mipmap: int) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the offset where the image's mipmap with index `mipmap` is stored in the `data` dictionary.

> method get_pixel(x: int, y: int) -> Color ; qualifiers=const

This is the same as `get_pixelv`, but with two integer arguments instead of a `Vector2i` argument.

> method get_pixelv(point: Vector2i) -> Color ; qualifiers=const

Returns the color of the pixel at `point`.
This is the same as `get_pixel`, but with a `Vector2i` argument instead of two integer arguments.

> method get_region(region: Rect2i) -> Image ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new `Image` that is a copy of this `Image`'s area specified with `region`.

> method get_size() -> Vector2i ; qualifiers=const

Loads an image from file `path`. See [Supported image formats]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/assets_pipeline/importing_images.html#supported-image-formats) for a list of supported image formats and limitations.
**Warning:** This method should only be used in the editor or in cases when you need to load external images at run-time, such as images located at the `user://` directory, and may not work in exported projects.
See also `ImageTexture` description for usage examples.

> method load_bmp_from_buffer(buffer: PackedByteArray) -> Error

Loads an image from the binary contents of a BMP file.
**Note:** Godot's BMP module doesn't support 16-bit per pixel images. Only 1-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit, 24-bit, and 32-bit per pixel images are supported.
**Note:** This method is only available in engine builds with the BMP module enabled. By default, the BMP module is enabled, but it can be disabled at build-time using the `module_bmp_enabled=no` SCons option.

> method load_dds_from_buffer(buffer: PackedByteArray) -> Error

Loads an image from the binary contents of a DDS file.
**Note:** This method is only available in engine builds with the DDS module enabled. By default, the DDS module is enabled, but it can be disabled at build-time using the `module_dds_enabled=no` SCons option.

> method load_exr_from_buffer(buffer: PackedByteArray) -> Error

**Note:** Godot's libktx implementation only supports 2D images. Cubemaps, texture arrays, and de-padding are not supported.
**Note:** This method is only available in engine builds with the KTX module enabled. By default, the KTX module is enabled, but it can be disabled at build-time using the `module_ktx_enabled=no` SCons option.

> method load_png_from_buffer(buffer: PackedByteArray) -> Error

Loads an image from the binary contents of a PNG file.

> method load_svg_from_buffer(buffer: PackedByteArray, scale: float = 1.0) -> Error

Loads an image from the UTF-8 binary contents of an **uncompressed** SVG file (**.svg**).
**Note:** Beware when using compressed SVG files (like **.svgz**), they need to be `decompressed` before loading.
**Note:** This method is only available in engine builds with the SVG module enabled. By default, the SVG module is enabled, but it can be disabled at build-time using the `module_svg_enabled=no` SCons option.

> method load_svg_from_string(svg_str: String, scale: float = 1.0) -> Error

Loads an image from the string contents of an SVG file (**.svg**).
**Note:** This method is only available in engine builds with the SVG module enabled. By default, the SVG module is enabled, but it can be disabled at build-time using the `module_svg_enabled=no` SCons option.

> method load_tga_from_buffer(buffer: PackedByteArray) -> Error

> method load_webp_from_buffer(buffer: PackedByteArray) -> Error

Loads an image from the binary contents of a WebP file.

> method normal_map_to_xy() -> void

Converts the image's data to represent coordinates on a 3D plane. This is used when the image represents a normal map. A normal map can add lots of detail to a 3D surface without increasing the polygon count.

> method premultiply_alpha() -> void

Multiplies color values with alpha values. Resulting color values for a pixel are `(color * alpha)/256`. See also `CanvasItemMaterial.blend_mode`.

> method resize(width: int, height: int, interpolation: Interpolation = 1) -> void

Resizes the image to the given `width` and `height`. New pixels are calculated using the `interpolation` mode defined via `Interpolation` constants.
**Note:** If the image's format is `FORMAT_RGBA4444`, `FORMAT_RGB565`, or `FORMAT_RGBE9995`, it will be temporarily converted to either `FORMAT_RGBA8` or `FORMAT_RGBAH`. This can affect the quality of the resized image.

> method resize_to_po2(square: bool = false, interpolation: Interpolation = 1) -> void

Resizes the image to the nearest power of 2 for the width and height. If `square` is `true`, sets width and height to be the same. New pixels are calculated using the `interpolation` mode defined via `Interpolation` constants.

> method rotate_180() -> void

Rotates the image by `180` degrees. The width and height of the image must be greater than `1`.

> method save_dds(path: String) -> Error ; qualifiers=const

Saves the image as a DDS (DirectDraw Surface) file to `path`. DDS is a container format that can store textures in various compression formats, such as DXT1, DXT5, or BC7. This function will return `ERR_UNAVAILABLE` if Godot was compiled without the DDS module.
**Note:** The DDS module may be disabled in certain builds, which means `save_dds` will return `ERR_UNAVAILABLE` when it is called from an exported project.

> method save_dds_to_buffer() -> PackedByteArray ; qualifiers=const

Saves the image as a DDS (DirectDraw Surface) file to a byte array. DDS is a container format that can store textures in various compression formats, such as DXT1, DXT5, or BC7. This function will return an empty byte array if Godot was compiled without the DDS module.
**Note:** The DDS module may be disabled in certain builds, which means `save_dds_to_buffer` will return an empty byte array when it is called from an exported project.

> method save_exr(path: String, grayscale: bool = false, color_image: bool = false, max_linear_value: float = -1.0) -> Error ; qualifiers=const

Saves the image as an EXR file to `path`. If `grayscale` is `true` and the image has only one channel, it will be saved explicitly as monochrome rather than one red channel. Set `color_image` to `true` when saving a color image, such as a screenshot. Negative values will be included when `color_image` is `false`, which may be useful for saving raw floating point data such as a lightmap that includes negative light information. Color component values in the resulting EXR file will not exceed `max_linear_value` if `max_linear_value` is not negative. This function will return `ERR_UNAVAILABLE` if Godot was compiled without the TinyEXR module.
When saving screenshots of a project that uses HDR output, use `Window.get_output_max_linear_value` for `max_linear_value`.

> method save_exr_to_buffer(grayscale: bool = false, color_image: bool = false, max_linear_value: float = -1.0) -> PackedByteArray ; qualifiers=const

Saves the image as an EXR file to a byte array. If `grayscale` is `true` and the image has only one channel, it will be saved explicitly as monochrome rather than one red channel. Set `color_image` to `true` when saving a color image, such as a screenshot. Negative values will be included when `color_image` is `false`, which may be useful for saving raw floating point data such as a lightmap that includes negative light information. Color component values in the resulting EXR file will not exceed `max_linear_value` if `max_linear_value` is not negative. This function will return an empty byte array if Godot was compiled without the TinyEXR module.
When saving screenshots of a project that uses HDR output, use `Window.get_output_max_linear_value` for `max_linear_value`.

> method save_jpg(path: String, quality: float = 0.75) -> Error ; qualifiers=const

Saves the image as a JPEG file to `path` with the specified `quality` between `0.01` and `1.0` (inclusive). Higher `quality` values result in better-looking output at the cost of larger file sizes. Recommended `quality` values are between `0.75` and `0.90`. Even at quality `1.00`, JPEG compression remains lossy.
**Note:** JPEG does not save an alpha channel. If the `Image` contains an alpha channel, the image will still be saved, but the resulting JPEG file won't contain the alpha channel.

> method save_jpg_to_buffer(quality: float = 0.75) -> PackedByteArray ; qualifiers=const

Saves the image as a JPEG file to a byte array with the specified `quality` between `0.01` and `1.0` (inclusive). Higher `quality` values result in better-looking output at the cost of larger byte array sizes (and therefore memory usage). Recommended `quality` values are between `0.75` and `0.90`. Even at quality `1.00`, JPEG compression remains lossy.
**Note:** JPEG does not save an alpha channel. If the `Image` contains an alpha channel, the image will still be saved, but the resulting byte array won't contain the alpha channel.

> method save_png(path: String) -> Error ; qualifiers=const

Saves the image as a PNG file to the file at `path`.

> method save_png_to_buffer() -> PackedByteArray ; qualifiers=const

Saves the image as a PNG file to a byte array.

> method save_webp(path: String, lossy: bool = false, quality: float = 0.75) -> Error ; qualifiers=const

Saves the image as a WebP (Web Picture) file to the file at `path`. By default it will save lossless. If `lossy` is `true`, the image will be saved lossy, using the `quality` setting between `0.0` and `1.0` (inclusive). Lossless WebP offers more efficient compression than PNG.
**Note:** The WebP format is limited to a size of 16383×16383 pixels, while PNG can save larger images.

> method save_webp_to_buffer(lossy: bool = false, quality: float = 0.75) -> PackedByteArray ; qualifiers=const

Saves the image as a WebP (Web Picture) file to a byte array. By default it will save lossless. If `lossy` is `true`, the image will be saved lossy, using the `quality` setting between `0.0` and `1.0` (inclusive). Lossless WebP offers more efficient compression than PNG.
**Note:** The WebP format is limited to a size of 16383×16383 pixels, while PNG can save larger images.

> method set_data(width: int, height: int, use_mipmaps: bool, format: Format, data: PackedByteArray) -> void

Overwrites data of an existing `Image`. Non-static equivalent of `create_from_data`.

> method set_pixel(x: int, y: int, color: Color) -> void

Sets the `Color` of the pixel at `(x, y)` to `color`.

```gdscript
                var img_width = 10
                var img_height = 5
                var img = Image.create(img_width, img_height, false, Image.FORMAT_RGBA8)

                img.set_pixel(1, 2, Color.RED) # Sets the color at (1, 2) to red.

```

```csharp
                int imgWidth = 10;
                int imgHeight = 5;
                var img = Image.Create(imgWidth, imgHeight, false, Image.Format.Rgba8);

                img.SetPixel(1, 2, Colors.Red); // Sets the color at (1, 2) to red.

```

This is the same as `set_pixelv`, but with a two integer arguments instead of a `Vector2i` argument.
**Note:** Depending on the image's format, the color set here may be clamped or lose precision. Do not assume the color returned by `get_pixel` to be identical to the one set here; any comparisons will likely need to use an approximation like `Color.is_equal_approx`.
**Note:** On grayscale image formats, only the red channel of `color` is used (and alpha if relevant). The green and blue channels are ignored.

> method set_pixelv(point: Vector2i, color: Color) -> void

Sets the `Color` of the pixel at `point` to `color`.

```gdscript
                var img_width = 10
                var img_height = 5
                var img = Image.create(img_width, img_height, false, Image.FORMAT_RGBA8)

                img.set_pixelv(Vector2i(1, 2), Color.RED) # Sets the color at (1, 2) to red.

```

```csharp
                int imgWidth = 10;
                int imgHeight = 5;
                var img = Image.Create(imgWidth, imgHeight, false, Image.Format.Rgba8);

                img.SetPixelv(new Vector2I(1, 2), Colors.Red); // Sets the color at (1, 2) to red.

```

This is the same as `set_pixel`, but with a `Vector2i` argument instead of two integer arguments.
**Note:** Depending on the image's format, the color set here may be clamped or lose precision. Do not assume the color returned by `get_pixelv` to be identical to the one set here; any comparisons will likely need to use an approximation like `Color.is_equal_approx`.
**Note:** On grayscale image formats, only the red channel of `color` is used (and alpha if relevant). The green and blue channels are ignored.

> method shrink_x2() -> void

Shrinks the image by a factor of 2 on each axis (this divides the pixel count by 4).

> method srgb_to_linear() -> void

Converts the raw data from nonlinear sRGB encoding to linear encoding using a lookup table. Only works on images with `FORMAT_RGB8` or `FORMAT_RGBA8` formats.
**Note:** The 8-bit formats required by this method are not suitable for storing linearly encoded values; a significant amount of color information will be lost in darker values. To maintain image quality, this method should not be used.

Represents the size of the `Format` enum.

> enum Interpolation

> enum_value Interpolation.INTERPOLATE_NEAREST = 0

Performs nearest-neighbor interpolation. If the image is resized, it will be pixelated.

> enum_value Interpolation.INTERPOLATE_BILINEAR = 1

Performs bilinear interpolation. If the image is resized, it will be blurry. This mode is faster than `INTERPOLATE_CUBIC`, but it results in lower quality.

> enum_value Interpolation.INTERPOLATE_CUBIC = 2

Performs cubic interpolation. If the image is resized, it will be blurry. This mode often gives better results compared to `INTERPOLATE_BILINEAR`, at the cost of being slower.

> enum_value Interpolation.INTERPOLATE_TRILINEAR = 3

Performs bilinear separately on the two most-suited mipmap levels, then linearly interpolates between them.
It's slower than `INTERPOLATE_BILINEAR`, but produces higher-quality results with far fewer aliasing artifacts.
If the image does not have mipmaps, they will be generated and used internally, but no mipmaps will be generated on the resulting image.
**Note:** If you intend to scale multiple copies of the original image, it's better to call `generate_mipmaps`] on it in advance, to avoid wasting processing power in generating them again and again.
On the other hand, if the image already has mipmaps, they will be used, and a new set will be generated for the resulting image.
