# ProjectSettings

> class ProjectSettings
> inherits ProjectSettings Object

## Brief

Stores globally-accessible variables.

## Description

Stores variables that can be accessed from everywhere. Use `get_setting`, `set_setting` or `has_setting` to access them. Variables stored in `project.godot` are also loaded into `ProjectSettings`, making this object very useful for reading custom game configuration options.
When naming a Project Settings property, use the full path to the setting including the category. For example, `"application/config/name"` for the project name. Category and property names can be viewed in the Project Settings dialog.
**Feature tags:** Project settings can be overridden for specific platforms and configurations (debug, release, ...) using [feature tags]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/export/feature_tags.html).
**Overriding:** Any project setting can be overridden by creating a file named `override.cfg` in the project's root directory. This file is in the same format as `project.godot`, and can also be written using `ConfigFile`. This can also be used in exported projects by placing this file in the same directory as the project binary. Overriding will still take the base project settings' [feature tags]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/export/feature_tags.html) in account. Therefore, make sure to *also* override the setting with the desired feature tags if you want them to override base project settings on all platforms and configurations.

## Properties

> property accessibility/general/accessibility_driver : String ; default="accesskit"

Accessibility driver:
-**accesskit** (default): AccessKit driver.
-**dummy**: Dummy driver, screen reader support is disabled.

> property accessibility/general/accessibility_support : int ; default=0

Accessibility support mode:
- **Auto** (`0`): Accessibility support is enabled, but updates to the accessibility information are processed only if an assistive app (such as a screen reader or a Braille display) is active (default).
- **Always Active** (`1`): Accessibility support is enabled, and updates to the accessibility information are always processed, regardless of the status of assistive apps.
- **Disabled** (`2`): Accessibility support is fully disabled.
**Note:** Accessibility debugging tools, such as Accessibility Insights for Windows, Accessibility Inspector (macOS), or AT-SPI Browser (Linux/BSD), do not count as assistive apps. To test your project with these tools, use **Always Active**.

> property accessibility/general/updates_per_second : int ; default=60

The number of accessibility information updates per second.

> property animation/compatibility/default_parent_skeleton_in_mesh_instance_3d : bool ; default=false

If `true`, `MeshInstance3D.skeleton` will point to the parent node (`..`) by default, which was the behavior before Godot 4.6. It's recommended to keep this setting disabled unless the old behavior is needed for compatibility.
**Note:** If you disable this option in an existing project, it's strongly recommended to use the `Project > Tools > Upgrade Project Files...` option to ensure existing scenes do not break.

> property animation/warnings/check_angle_interpolation_type_conflicting : bool ; default=true

If `true`, `AnimationMixer` prints the warning of interpolation being forced to choose the shortest rotation path due to multiple angle interpolation types being mixed in the `AnimationMixer` cache.

> property animation/warnings/check_invalid_skeleton_modifier_node_paths : bool ; default=true

If `true`, `SkeletonModifier3D` prints a warning if there's no matching object for the track path in the scene when assigning.

> property animation/warnings/check_invalid_track_paths : bool ; default=true

If `true`, `AnimationMixer` prints the warning of no matching object of the track path in the scene.

> property application/boot_splash/bg_color : Color ; default=Color(0.14, 0.14, 0.14, 1)

Background color for the boot splash.

> property application/boot_splash/image : String ; default=""

Path to an image used as the boot splash. If left empty, the default Godot Engine splash will be displayed instead.
**Note:** Only effective if `application/boot_splash/show_image` is `true`.
**Note:** The only supported format is PNG. Using another image format will result in an error.
**Note:** The image will also show when opening the project in the editor. If you want to display the default splash image in the editor, add an empty override for `editor_hint` feature.

> property application/boot_splash/minimum_display_time : int ; default=0

Minimum boot splash display time (in milliseconds). It is not recommended to set too high values for this setting.

> property application/boot_splash/show_image : bool ; default=true

If `true`, displays the image specified in `application/boot_splash/image` when the engine starts. If `false`, only displays the plain color specified in `application/boot_splash/bg_color`.

> property application/boot_splash/stretch_mode : int ; default=1

Specifies how the splash image will be stretched. For the original size without stretching, set to disabled. See `RenderingServer.SplashStretchMode` constants for more information.

> property application/boot_splash/use_filter : bool ; default=true

If `true`, applies linear filtering when scaling the image (recommended for high-resolution artwork). If `false`, uses nearest-neighbor interpolation (recommended for pixel art).

> property application/config/auto_accept_quit : bool ; default=true

If `true`, the application automatically accepts quitting requests.

> property application/config/custom_user_dir_name : String ; default=""

This user directory is used for storing persistent data (`user://` filesystem). If a custom directory name is defined, this name will be appended to the system-specific user data directory (same parent folder as the Godot configuration folder documented in `OS.get_user_data_dir`).
The `application/config/use_custom_user_dir` setting must be enabled for this to take effect.
**Note:** If `application/config/custom_user_dir_name` contains trailing periods, they will be stripped as folder names ending with a period are not allowed on Windows.

> property application/config/description : String ; default=""

The project's description, displayed as a tooltip in the Project Manager when hovering the project.

> property application/config/disable_project_settings_override : bool ; default=false

If `true`, disables loading of project settings overrides (file defined in `application/config/project_settings_override` and `res://override.cfg`) and related CLI arguments.

> property application/config/icon : String ; default=""

Icon used for the project, set when project loads. Exporters will also use this icon as a fallback if necessary.

> property application/config/macos_native_icon : String ; default=""

Icon set in `.icns` format used on macOS to set the game's icon. This is done automatically on start by calling `DisplayServer.set_native_icon`.

> property application/config/name : String ; default=""

The project's name. It is used both by the Project Manager and by exporters. The project name can be translated by translating its value in localization files. The window title will be set to match the project name automatically on startup.
**Note:** Changing this value will also change the user data folder's path if `application/config/use_custom_user_dir` is `false`. After renaming the project, you will no longer be able to access existing data in `user://` unless you rename the old folder to match the new project name. See [Data paths]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/io/data_paths.html) in the documentation for more information.

> property application/config/name_localized : Dictionary ; default={}

Translations of the project's name. This setting is used by OS tools to translate application name on Android, iOS and macOS.
**Note:** When left empty, the application name is translated using the project translations.

> property application/config/project_settings_override : String ; default=""

Specifies a file to override project settings. For example: `user://custom_settings.cfg`. See "Overriding" in the `ProjectSettings` class description at the top for more information.
**Note:** Regardless of this setting's value, `res://override.cfg` will still be read to override the project settings.

> property application/config/quit_on_go_back : bool ; default=true

If `true`, the application quits automatically when navigating back (e.g. using the system "Back" button on Android).

> property application/config/use_custom_user_dir : bool ; default=false

If `true`, the project will save user data to its own user directory. If `application/config/custom_user_dir_name` is empty, `<OS user data directory>/<project name>` directory will be used. If `false`, the project will save user data to `<OS user data directory>/Godot/app_userdata/<project name>`.
See also [File paths in Godot projects]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/io/data_paths.html#accessing-persistent-user-data-user). This setting is only effective on desktop platforms.

> property application/config/use_hidden_project_data_directory : bool ; default=true

If `true`, the project will use a hidden directory (`.godot`) for storing project-specific data (metadata, shader cache, etc.).
If `false`, a non-hidden directory (`godot`) will be used instead.
**Note:** Restart the application after changing this setting.
**Note:** Changing this value can help on platforms or with third-party tools where hidden directory patterns are disallowed. Only modify this setting if you know that your environment requires it, as changing the default can impact compatibility with some external tools or plugins which expect the default `.godot` folder.

> property application/config/version : String ; default=""

The project's human-readable version identifier. This is used by exporters if the version identifier isn't overridden there. If `application/config/version` is an empty string and the version identifier isn't overridden in an exporter, the exporter will use `1.0.0` as a version identifier.

> property application/config/windows_native_icon : String ; default=""

Icon set in `.ico` format used on Windows to set the game's icon. This is done automatically on start by calling `DisplayServer.set_native_icon`.

> property application/run/delta_smoothing : bool ; default=true

Time samples for frame deltas are subject to random variation introduced by the platform, even when frames are displayed at regular intervals thanks to V-Sync. This can lead to jitter. Delta smoothing can often give a better result by filtering the input deltas to correct for minor fluctuations from the refresh rate.
**Note:** Delta smoothing is only attempted when `display/window/vsync/vsync_mode` is set to `enabled`, as it does not work well without V-Sync.
It may take several seconds at a stable frame rate before the smoothing is initially activated. It will only be active on machines where performance is adequate to render frames at the refresh rate.

> property application/run/disable_stderr : bool ; default=false

If `true`, disables printing to standard error. If `true`, this also hides error and warning messages printed by `@GlobalScope.push_error` and `@GlobalScope.push_warning`. See also `application/run/disable_stdout`.
Changes to this setting will only be applied upon restarting the application. To control this at runtime, use `Engine.print_error_messages`.

> property application/run/disable_stdout : bool ; default=false

If `true`, disables printing to standard output. This is equivalent to starting the editor or project with the `--quiet` [command line argument]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/editor/command_line_tutorial.html). See also `application/run/disable_stderr`.
Changes to this setting will only be applied upon restarting the application. To control this at runtime, use `Engine.print_to_stdout`.

> property application/run/enable_alt_space_menu : bool ; default=false

If `true`, allows the `Alt + Space` keys to display the window menu. This menu allows the user to perform various window management operations such as moving, resizing, or minimizing the window.
**Note:** When the menu is displayed, project execution will pause until the menu is *fully* closed due to Windows behavior. Consider this when enabling this setting in a networked multiplayer game. The menu is only considered fully closed when an option is selected, when the user clicks outside, or when `Escape` is pressed after bringing up the window menu *and* another key is pressed afterwards.
**Note:** This setting is implemented only on Windows.

> property application/run/flush_stdout_on_print : bool ; default=false

If `true`, flushes the standard output stream every time a line is printed. This affects both terminal logging and file logging.
When running a project, this setting must be enabled if you want logs to be collected by service managers such as systemd/journalctl. This setting is disabled by default on release builds, since flushing on every printed line will negatively affect performance if lots of lines are printed in a rapid succession. Also, if this setting is enabled, logged files will still be written successfully if the application crashes or is otherwise killed by the user (without being closed "normally").
**Note:** Regardless of this setting, the standard error stream (`stderr`) is always flushed when a line is printed to it.
Changes to this setting will only be applied upon restarting the application.

> property application/run/flush_stdout_on_print.debug : bool ; default=true

Debug build override for `application/run/flush_stdout_on_print`, as performance is less important during debugging.
Changes to this setting will only be applied upon restarting the application.

> property application/run/frame_delay_msec : int ; default=0

Forces a *constant* delay between frames in the main loop (in milliseconds). In most situations, `application/run/max_fps` should be preferred as an FPS limiter as it's more precise.
This setting can be overridden using the `--frame-delay <ms;>` command line argument.

> property application/run/load_shell_environment : bool ; default=false

If `true`, loads the default shell and copies environment variables set by the shell startup scripts to the app environment.
**Note:** This setting is implemented on macOS for non-sandboxed applications only.

> property application/run/low_processor_mode : bool ; default=false

If `true`, enables low-processor usage mode. When enabled, the engine takes longer to redraw, but only redraws the screen if necessary. This may lower power consumption, and is intended for editors or mobile applications. For most games, because the screen needs to be redrawn every frame, it is recommended to keep this setting disabled.

> property application/run/low_processor_mode_sleep_usec : int ; default=6900

Amount of sleeping between frames when the low-processor usage mode is enabled (in microseconds). Higher values will result in lower CPU usage.

> property application/run/main_loop_type : String ; default="SceneTree"

The name of the type implementing the engine's main loop.

> property application/run/main_scene : String ; default=""

Path to the main scene file that will be loaded when the project runs.

> property application/run/max_fps : int ; default=0

Maximum number of frames per second allowed. A value of `0` means "no limit". The actual number of frames per second may still be below this value if the CPU or GPU cannot keep up with the project logic and rendering.
Limiting the FPS can be useful to reduce system power consumption, which reduces heat and noise emissions (and improves battery life on mobile devices).
If `display/window/vsync/vsync_mode` is set to `Enabled` or `Adaptive`, it takes precedence and the forced FPS number cannot exceed the monitor's refresh rate. See also `DisplayServer.screen_get_refresh_rate`.
If `display/window/vsync/vsync_mode` is `Enabled`, on monitors with variable refresh rate enabled (G-Sync/FreeSync), using an FPS limit slightly lower than the monitor's refresh rate will [reduce input lag while avoiding tearing](https://blurbusters.com/howto-low-lag-vsync-on/). At higher refresh rates, the difference between the FPS limit and the monitor refresh rate should be increased to ensure frames to account for timing inaccuracies. The optimal formula for the FPS limit value in this scenario is `r - (r * r) / 3600.0`, where `r` is the monitor's refresh rate.
If `display/window/vsync/vsync_mode` is `Disabled`, limiting the FPS to a high value that can be consistently reached on the system can reduce input lag compared to an uncapped framerate. Since this works by ensuring the GPU load is lower than 100%, this latency reduction is only effective in GPU-bottlenecked scenarios, not CPU-bottlenecked scenarios.
See also `physics/common/physics_ticks_per_second`.
This setting can be overridden using the `--max-fps <fps>` command line argument (including with a value of `0` for unlimited framerate).
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To change the rendering FPS cap at runtime, set `Engine.max_fps` instead.

> property application/run/print_header : bool ; default=true

If `true`, the engine header is printed in the console on startup. This header describes the current version of the engine, as well as the renderer being used. This behavior can also be disabled on the command line with the `--no-header` option.

> property audio/buses/channel_disable_threshold_db : float ; default=-60.0

Audio buses will disable automatically when sound goes below a given dB threshold for a given time. This saves CPU as effects assigned to that bus will no longer do any processing.

> property audio/buses/channel_disable_time : float ; default=2.0

Audio buses will disable automatically when sound goes below a given dB threshold for a given time. This saves CPU as effects assigned to that bus will no longer do any processing.

> property audio/buses/default_bus_layout : String ; default="res://default_bus_layout.tres"

Default `AudioBusLayout` resource file to use in the project, unless overridden by the scene.

> property audio/driver/driver : String

Specifies the audio driver to use. This setting is platform-dependent as each platform supports different audio drivers. If left empty, the default audio driver will be used.
The `Dummy` audio driver disables all audio playback and recording, which is useful for non-game applications as it reduces CPU usage. It also prevents the engine from appearing as an application playing audio in the OS' audio mixer.
To query the value that is being used at run-time (which may be overridden by command-line arguments or headless mode), use `AudioServer.get_driver_name`.
**Note:** The driver in use can be overridden at runtime via the `--audio-driver` [command line argument]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/editor/command_line_tutorial.html).

> property audio/driver/enable_input : bool ; default=false

If `true`, microphone input will be allowed. This requires appropriate permissions to be set when exporting to Android or iOS.
**Note:** If the operating system blocks access to audio input devices (due to the user's privacy settings), audio capture will only return silence. On Windows, make sure that apps are allowed to access the microphone in the OS' privacy settings.

> property audio/driver/mix_rate : int ; default=44100

Target mixing rate used for audio (in Hz). In general, it's better to not touch this and leave it to the host operating system.
**Note:** On iOS and macOS, mixing rate is determined by audio driver, this value is ignored.
**Note:** Input and output mixing rates might be different. Use `AudioServer.get_mix_rate` and `AudioServer.get_input_mix_rate` to get actual values.

> property audio/driver/mix_rate.web : int ; default=0

Safer override for `audio/driver/mix_rate` in the Web platform. Here `0` means "let the browser choose" (since some browsers do not like forcing the mix rate).

> property audio/driver/output_latency : int ; default=15

Specifies the preferred output latency in milliseconds for audio. Lower values will result in lower audio latency at the cost of increased CPU usage. Low values may result in audible crackling on slower hardware.
Audio output latency may be constrained by the host operating system and audio hardware drivers. If the host can not provide the specified audio output latency then Godot will attempt to use the nearest latency allowed by the host. As such you should always use `AudioServer.get_output_latency` to determine the actual audio output latency.
Audio output latency can be overridden using the `--audio-output-latency <ms>` command line argument.
**Note:** This setting is ignored on Android.

> property audio/driver/output_latency.web : int ; default=50

Safer override for `audio/driver/output_latency` in the Web platform, to avoid audio issues especially on mobile devices.

> property audio/general/2d_panning_strength : float ; default=0.5

The base strength of the panning effect for all `AudioStreamPlayer2D` nodes. The panning strength can be further scaled on each Node using `AudioStreamPlayer2D.panning_strength`. A value of `0.0` disables stereo panning entirely, leaving only volume attenuation in place. A value of `1.0` completely mutes one of the channels if the sound is located exactly to the left (or right) of the listener.
The default value of `0.5` is tuned for headphones. When using speakers, you may find lower values to sound better as speakers have a lower stereo separation compared to headphones.

> property audio/general/3d_panning_strength : float ; default=0.5

The base strength of the panning effect for all `AudioStreamPlayer3D` nodes. The panning strength can be further scaled on each Node using `AudioStreamPlayer3D.panning_strength`. A value of `0.0` disables stereo panning entirely, leaving only volume attenuation in place. A value of `1.0` completely mutes one of the channels if the sound is located exactly to the left (or right) of the listener.
The default value of `0.5` is tuned for headphones which means that the opposite side channel goes no lower than 50% of the volume of the nearside channel. You may find that you can set this value higher for speakers to have the same effect since both ears can hear from each speaker.

> property audio/general/default_playback_type : int ; default=0 ; experimental=This property may be changed or removed in future versions.

Specifies the default playback type of the platform.
The default value is set to **Stream**, as most platforms have no issues mixing streams.

> property audio/general/default_playback_type.web : int ; default=1 ; experimental=This property may be changed or removed in future versions.

Specifies the default playback type of the Web platform.
The default value is set to **Sample** as the Web platform is not suited to mix audio streams outside of the Web Audio API, especially when exporting a single-threaded game. **Sample** allows for lower latency on the web platform at the cost of flexibility (`AudioEffect`s are not supported).
**Warning:** Forcing **Stream** on the Web platform may cause high audio latency and crackling, especially when exporting a multi-threaded game.

> property audio/general/ios/mix_with_others : bool ; default=false

Sets the [mixWithOthers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudiosession/categoryoptions/1616611-mixwithothers) option for the AVAudioSession on iOS. This will override the mix behavior, if the category is set to `Play and Record`, `Playback`, or `Multi Route`.
`Ambient` always has this set per default.

> property audio/general/ios/session_category : int ; default=0

Sets the [AVAudioSessionCategory](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudiosessioncategory) on iOS. Use the `Playback` category to get sound output, even if the phone is in silent mode.

> property audio/general/text_to_speech : bool ; default=false

If `true`, text-to-speech support is enabled on startup, otherwise it is enabled the first time any TTS method is used. See also `DisplayServer.tts_get_voices` and `DisplayServer.tts_speak`.
**Note:** Enabling TTS can cause additional idle CPU usage and interfere with the sleep mode, so consider disabling it if TTS is not used.

> property audio/video/video_delay_compensation_ms : int ; default=0

Setting to hardcode audio delay when playing video. Best to leave this unchanged unless you know what you are doing.

> property collada/use_ambient : bool ; default=false

If `true`, ambient lights will be imported from COLLADA models as `DirectionalLight3D`. If `false`, ambient lights will be ignored.

> property compression/formats/gzip/compression_level : int ; default=-1

The default compression level for gzip. Affects compressed scenes and resources. Higher levels result in smaller files at the cost of compression speed. Decompression speed is mostly unaffected by the compression level. `-1` uses the default gzip compression level, which is identical to `6` but could change in the future due to underlying zlib updates.

> property compression/formats/zlib/compression_level : int ; default=-1

The default compression level for Zlib. Affects compressed scenes and resources. Higher levels result in smaller files at the cost of compression speed. Decompression speed is mostly unaffected by the compression level. `-1` uses the default gzip compression level, which is identical to `6` but could change in the future due to underlying zlib updates.

> property compression/formats/zstd/compression_level : int ; default=3

The default compression level for Zstandard. Affects compressed scenes and resources. Higher levels result in smaller files at the cost of compression speed. Decompression speed is mostly unaffected by the compression level.

> property compression/formats/zstd/long_distance_matching : bool ; default=false

Enables [long-distance matching](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.3.2) in Zstandard.

> property compression/formats/zstd/window_log_size : int ; default=27

Largest size limit (in power of 2) allowed when compressing using long-distance matching with Zstandard. Higher values can result in better compression, but will require more memory when compressing and decompressing.

> property debug/canvas_items/debug_redraw_color : Color ; default=Color(1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.5)

If canvas item redraw debugging is active, this color will be flashed on canvas items when they redraw.

> property debug/canvas_items/debug_redraw_time : float ; default=1.0

If canvas item redraw debugging is active, this will be the time the flash will last each time they redraw.

> property debug/file_logging/enable_file_logging : bool ; default=false

If `true`, logs all output and error messages to files. See also `debug/file_logging/log_path`, `debug/file_logging/max_log_files`, and `application/run/flush_stdout_on_print`.

> property debug/file_logging/enable_file_logging.pc : bool ; default=true

Desktop override for `debug/file_logging/enable_file_logging`, as log files are not readily accessible on mobile/Web platforms.

> property debug/file_logging/log_path : String ; default="user://logs/godot.log"

Path at which to store log files for the project. Using a path under `user://` is recommended.
This can be specified manually on the command line using the `--log-file <file>` [command line argument]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/editor/command_line_tutorial.html). If this command line argument is specified, log rotation is automatically disabled (see `debug/file_logging/max_log_files`).

> property debug/file_logging/max_log_files : int ; default=5

Specifies the maximum number of log files allowed (used for rotation). Set to `1` to disable log file rotation.
If the `--log-file <file>` [command line argument]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/editor/command_line_tutorial.html) is used, log rotation is always disabled.

> property debug/gdscript/warnings/assert_always_false : int ; default=1

When set to **Warn** or **Error**, produces a warning or an error respectively when an `assert` call always evaluates to `false`.

> property debug/gdscript/warnings/assert_always_true : int ; default=1

When set to **Warn** or **Error**, produces a warning or an error respectively when an `assert` call always evaluates to `true`.

> property debug/gdscript/warnings/confusable_capture_reassignment : int ; default=1

When set to **Warn** or **Error**, produces a warning or an error respectively when a local variable captured by a lambda is reassigned, since this does not modify the outer local variable.

> property debug/gdscript/warnings/confusable_identifier : int ; default=1

When set to **Warn** or **Error**, produces a warning or an error respectively when an identifier contains characters that can be confused with something else, like when mixing different alphabets.

> property debug/gdscript/warnings/confusable_local_declaration : int ; default=1

When set to **Warn** or **Error**, produces a warning or an error respectively when an identifier declared in the nested block has the same name as an identifier declared below in the parent block.

> property debug/gdscript/warnings/confusable_local_usage : int ; default=1

When set to **Warn** or **Error**, produces a warning or an error respectively when an identifier that will be shadowed below in the block is used.

> property debug/gdscript/warnings/confusable_temporary_modification : int ; default=1

When set to **Warn** or **Error**, produces a warning or an error respectively when a built-in property of type `Packed*Array` is modified using a complex assignment chain or a non-`const` method call. In this case, you are only modifying a temporary value, and the property's value remains unchanged.

> property debug/gdscript/warnings/deprecated_keyword : int ; default=1

When set to **Warn** or **Error**, produces a warning or an error respectively when deprecated keywords are used.
**Note:** There are currently no deprecated keywords, so this warning is never produced.

> property debug/gdscript/warnings/directory_rules : Dictionary ; default={ "res://addons": 0 }

The rules for including or excluding scripts when generating warnings, as a dictionary. Each rule is an entry consisting of a directory path (key) and a decision (value). When trying to generate a warning, the GDScript parser chooses the most specific rule, i.e. the most nested directory containing the script. If the decision is **Exclude**, warnings are not generated for this script. If the decision is **Include** or the script doesn't satisfy any of the rules, the warning configuration specified in the Project Settings is applied.
It is recommended to include your own addons/libraries, either project-specific or actively being developed at the moment. Third-party or project-agnostic addons/libraries should be excluded, as they may be incompatible with the project's warning configuration.
**Note:** It is not recommended to remove or change the rule for `"res://addons"` as the project's warning configuration may break third-party addons. Instead, consider including individual addons, if necessary.
**Note:** The editor does not check whether the specified paths are existing directories. It also does not automatically update these paths when directories are moved.

> property debug/gdscript/warnings/empty_file : int ; default=1

When set to **Warn** or **Error**, produces a warning or an error respectively when an empty file is parsed.

> property debug/gdscript/warnings/enable : bool ; default=true

If `true`, enables specific GDScript warnings (see `debug/gdscript/warnings/*` settings). If `false`, disables all GDScript warnings.

> property debug/gdscript/warnings/enum_variable_without_default : int ; default=1

When set to **Warn** or **Error**, produces a warning or an error respectively when a variable has an enum type but no explicit default value, but only if the enum does not contain `0` as a valid value.

> property debug/gdscript/warnings/get_node_default_without_onready : int ; default=2

When set to **Warn** or **Error**, produces a warning or an error respectively when `Node.get_node` (or the shorthand `$`) is used as default value of a class variable without the `@onready` annotation.

> property debug/gdscript/warnings/incompatible_ternary : int ; default=1

When set to **Warn** or **Error**, produces a warning or an error respectively when a ternary operator may emit values with incompatible types.

> property debug/gdscript/warnings/inference_on_variant : int ; default=2

When set to **Warn** or **Error**, produces a warning or an error respectively when a static inferred type uses a `Variant` as initial value, which makes the static type to also be Variant.

> property debug/gdscript/warnings/inferred_declaration : int ; default=0

When set to **Warn** or **Error**, produces a warning or an error respectively when a variable, constant, or parameter has an implicitly inferred static type. In GDScript, type inference is performed by declaring a variable with `:=` instead of `=` and leaving out the type specifier. For example, `var x := 1` will *infer* the `int` type, while `var x: int = 1` explicitly declares the variable as `int`.
**Note:** This warning is recommended *in addition* to `debug/gdscript/warnings/untyped_declaration` if you want to always specify the type explicitly. Having `INFERRED_DECLARATION` warning level higher than `UNTYPED_DECLARATION` warning level makes little sense and is not recommended.

> property debug/gdscript/warnings/int_as_enum_without_cast : int ; default=1

> property debug/settings/gdscript/always_track_local_variables : bool ; default=false

Whether GDScript local variables will be tracked in all builds, including export builds, thus allowing `Engine.capture_script_backtraces` to capture them when enabling its `include_variables` parameter.
Enabling this comes at the cost of roughly 50 bytes of memory per local variable, for every compiled class in the entire project, so can be several MiB in larger projects.
**Note:** This setting has no effect when running the game from the editor, where GDScript local variables are tracked regardless.

Print more information to standard output when running. It displays information such as memory leaks, which scenes and resources are being loaded, etc. This can also be enabled using the `--verbose` or `-v` [command line argument]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/editor/command_line_tutorial.html), even on an exported project. See also `OS.is_stdout_verbose` and `@GlobalScope.print_verbose`.

> property display/display_server/driver : String

Sets the driver to be used by the display server. This property can not be edited directly, instead, set the driver using the platform-specific overrides.

> property display/display_server/driver.android : String

Android override for `display/display_server/driver`.

> property display/display_server/driver.ios : String

iOS override for `display/display_server/driver`.

> property display/display_server/driver.linuxbsd : String

LinuxBSD override for `display/display_server/driver`.

> property display/display_server/driver.macos : String

Windows override for `display/display_server/driver`.

> property display/mouse_cursor/custom_image : String ; default=""

Custom image for the mouse cursor (limited to 256×256).

> property display/mouse_cursor/custom_image_hotspot : Vector2 ; default=Vector2(0, 0)

Hotspot for the custom mouse cursor image.

> property display/mouse_cursor/tooltip_position_offset : Vector2 ; default=Vector2(10, 10)

Position offset for tooltips, relative to the mouse cursor's hotspot.

> property display/window/dpi/allow_hidpi : bool ; default=true

If `true`, allows HiDPI display on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS and Web. If `false`, the platform's low-DPI fallback will be used on HiDPI displays, which causes the window to be displayed in a blurry or pixelated manner (and can cause various window management bugs). Therefore, it is recommended to make your project scale to [multiple resolutions]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/rendering/multiple_resolutions.html) instead of disabling this setting.
**Note:** This setting has no effect on Linux as DPI-awareness fallbacks are not supported there.

> property display/window/energy_saving/keep_screen_on : bool ; default=true

If `true`, keeps the screen on (even in case of inactivity), so the screensaver does not take over. Works on desktop and mobile platforms.

> property display/window/frame_pacing/android/enable_frame_pacing : bool ; default=true

Enable Swappy for stable frame pacing on Android. Highly recommended.
**Note:** This option will be forced off when using OpenXR.

> property display/window/frame_pacing/android/swappy_mode : int ; default=2

Swappy mode to use. The options are:
- `pipeline_forced_on`: Try to honor `Engine.max_fps`. Pipelining is always on. This is the same behavior as a desktop PC.
- `auto_fps_pipeline_forced_on`: Calculate the max FPS automatically. The actual max FPS will be between `0` and `Engine.max_fps`. While this sounds convenient, beware that Swappy will often downgrade the max FPS until it finds a value that can be maintained. That means, if your game runs between 40fps and 60fps on a 60hz screen, after some time Swappy will downgrade the max FPS so that the game renders at a perfect 30fps.
- `auto_fps_auto_pipeline`: Same as `auto_fps_pipeline_forced_on`, but if Swappy detects that rendering is very fast (for example it takes less than 8ms to render on a 60hz screen), Swappy will disable pipelining to minimize input latency. This is the default.
**Note:** If `Engine.max_fps` is `0`, the actual max FPS will be considered to be the screen's refresh rate (often 60hz, 90hz, or 120hz, depending on device model and OS settings).

> property display/window/handheld/orientation : int ; default=0

The default screen orientation to use on mobile devices. See `DisplayServer.ScreenOrientation` for possible values.
**Note:** When set to a portrait orientation, this project setting does not flip the project resolution's width and height automatically. Instead, you have to set `display/window/size/viewport_width` and `display/window/size/viewport_height` accordingly.

> property display/window/hdr/request_hdr_output : bool ; default=false

If `true`, HDR output is requested for the main window and the editor. The main window and editor will automatically switch between HDR and SDR if it is moved between screens, screen capabilities change, or system settings are modified. This will internally force `Viewport.use_hdr_2d` to be enabled on the main `Viewport`. All other `SubViewport` of the `Window` must have their `Viewport.use_hdr_2d` property enabled to produce HDR output.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To change this property at runtime, set `Window.hdr_output_requested`.

> property display/window/ios/allow_high_refresh_rate : bool ; default=true

If `true`, iOS devices that support high refresh rate/"ProMotion" will be allowed to render at up to 120 frames per second.

> property display/window/ios/hide_home_indicator : bool ; default=true

If `true`, the home indicator is hidden automatically. This only affects iOS devices without a physical home button.

> property display/window/ios/hide_status_bar : bool ; default=true

If `true`, the status bar is hidden while the app is running.

> property display/window/ios/suppress_ui_gesture : bool ; default=true

If `true`, it will require two swipes to access iOS UI that uses gestures.
**Note:** This setting has no effect on the home indicator if `hide_home_indicator` is `true`.

> property display/window/per_pixel_transparency/allowed : bool ; default=false

If `true`, allows per-pixel transparency for the window background. This affects performance, so leave it on `false` unless you need it. See also `display/window/size/transparent` and `rendering/viewport/transparent_background`.

> property display/window/size/always_on_top : bool ; default=false

Forces the main window to be always on top.
**Note:** This setting is ignored on iOS, Android, and Web.

> property display/window/size/borderless : bool ; default=false

Forces the main window to be borderless.
**Note:** This setting is ignored on iOS, Android, and Web.

> property display/window/size/extend_to_title : bool ; default=false

Main window content is expanded to the full size of the window. Unlike a borderless window, the frame is left intact and can be used to resize the window, and the title bar is transparent, but has minimize/maximize/close buttons.
**Note:** This setting is implemented only on macOS.

> property display/window/size/initial_position : Vector2i ; default=Vector2i(0, 0)

Main window initial position (in virtual desktop coordinates), this setting is used only if `display/window/size/initial_position_type` is set to "Absolute" (`0`).
**Note:** This setting only affects the exported project, or when the project is run from the command line. In the editor, the value of `EditorSettings.run/window_placement/rect_custom_position` is used instead.

> property display/window/size/initial_position_type : int ; default=1

Main window initial position.
`0` - "Absolute", `display/window/size/initial_position` is used to set window position.
`1` - "Primary Screen Center".
`3` - "Other Screen Center", `display/window/size/initial_screen` is used to set the screen.
`4` - "Center of Screen With Mouse Pointer".
`5` - "Center of Screen With Keyboard Focus".
**Note:** This setting only affects the exported project, or when the project is run from the command line. In the editor, the value of `EditorSettings.run/window_placement/rect` is used instead.

> property display/window/size/initial_screen : int ; default=0

Main window initial screen, this setting is used only if `display/window/size/initial_position_type` is set to "Other Screen Center" (`2`).
**Note:** This setting only affects the exported project, or when the project is run from the command line. In the editor, the value of `EditorSettings.run/window_placement/screen` is used instead.

> property display/window/size/maximize_disabled : bool ; default=false

If `true`, the main window's maximize button is disabled.

> property display/window/size/minimize_disabled : bool ; default=false

If `true`, the main window's minimize button is disabled.

> property display/window/size/mode : int ; default=0

Main window mode. See `DisplayServer.WindowMode` for possible values and how each mode behaves.
**Note:** Game embedding is available only in the "Windowed" mode.

> property display/window/size/no_focus : bool ; default=false

Main window can't be focused. No-focus window will ignore all input, except mouse clicks.

> property display/window/size/resizable : bool ; default=true

If `true`, allows the window to be resizable by default.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To change whether the window is resizable at runtime, set `Window.unresizable` instead on the root Window, which can be retrieved using `get_viewport().get_window()`. `Window.unresizable` takes the opposite value of this setting.
**Note:** Certain window managers can be configured to ignore the non-resizable status of a window. Do not rely on this setting as a guarantee that the window will *never* be resizable.
**Note:** This setting is ignored on iOS.

> property display/window/size/sharp_corners : bool ; default=false

If `true`, the main window uses sharp corners by default.
**Note:** This property is implemented only on Windows (11).

> property display/window/size/transparent : bool ; default=false

If `true`, enables a window manager hint that the main window background *can* be transparent. This does not make the background actually transparent. For the background to be transparent, the root viewport must also be made transparent by enabling `rendering/viewport/transparent_background`.
**Note:** To use a transparent splash screen, set `application/boot_splash/bg_color` to `Color(0, 0, 0, 0)`.
**Note:** This setting has no effect if `display/window/per_pixel_transparency/allowed` is set to `false`.
**Note:** This setting has no effect on Android as transparency is controlled only via `display/window/per_pixel_transparency/allowed`.

> property display/window/size/viewport_height : int ; default=648

Sets the game's main viewport height. On desktop platforms, this is also the initial window height, represented by an indigo-colored rectangle in the 2D editor. Stretch mode settings also use this as a reference when using the `canvas_items` or `viewport` stretch modes. See also `display/window/size/viewport_width`, `display/window/size/window_width_override` and `display/window/size/window_height_override`.

> property display/window/size/viewport_width : int ; default=1152

Sets the game's main viewport width. On desktop platforms, this is also the initial window width, represented by an indigo-colored rectangle in the 2D editor. Stretch mode settings also use this as a reference when using the `canvas_items` or `viewport` stretch modes. See also `display/window/size/viewport_height`, `display/window/size/window_width_override` and `display/window/size/window_height_override`.

> property display/window/size/window_height_override : int ; default=0

On desktop platforms, overrides the game's initial window height. See also `display/window/size/window_width_override`, `display/window/size/viewport_width` and `display/window/size/viewport_height`.
**Note:** By default, or when set to `0`, the initial window height is the `display/window/size/viewport_height`. This setting is ignored on iOS, Android, and Web.

> property display/window/size/window_width_override : int ; default=0

On desktop platforms, overrides the game's initial window width. See also `display/window/size/window_height_override`, `display/window/size/viewport_width` and `display/window/size/viewport_height`.
**Note:** By default, or when set to `0`, the initial window width is the `display/window/size/viewport_width`. This setting is ignored on iOS, Android, and Web.

> property display/window/stretch/aspect : String ; default="keep"

Defines how the aspect ratio of the base size is preserved when stretching to fit the resolution of the window or screen.
`"ignore"`: Ignore the aspect ratio when stretching the screen. This means that the original resolution will be stretched to exactly fill the screen, even if it's wider or narrower. This may result in non-uniform stretching: things looking wider or taller than designed.
`"keep"`: Keep aspect ratio when stretching the screen. This means that the viewport retains its original size regardless of the screen resolution, and black bars will be added to the top/bottom of the screen ("letterboxing") or the sides ("pillarboxing").
`"keep_width"`: Keep aspect ratio when stretching the screen. If the screen is wider than the base size, black bars are added at the left and right (pillarboxing). But if the screen is taller than the base resolution, the viewport will be grown in the vertical direction (and more content will be visible at the bottom). You can also think of this as "Expand Vertically".
`"keep_height"`: Keep aspect ratio when stretching the screen. If the screen is taller than the base size, black bars are added at the top and bottom (letterboxing). But if the screen is wider than the base resolution, the viewport will be grown in the horizontal direction (and more content will be visible to the right). You can also think of this as "Expand Horizontally".
`"expand"`: Keep aspect ratio when stretching the screen, but keep neither the base width nor height. Depending on the screen aspect ratio, the viewport will either be larger in the horizontal direction (if the screen is wider than the base size) or in the vertical direction (if the screen is taller than the original size). This is the default for projects created starting in Godot 4.7.

> property display/window/stretch/mode : String ; default="disabled"

Defines how the base size is stretched to fit the resolution of the window or screen.
`"disabled"`: No stretching happens. One unit in the scene corresponds to one pixel on the screen. In this mode, `display/window/stretch/aspect` has no effect. Recommended for non-game applications.
`"canvas_items"`: The base size specified in width and height in the project settings is stretched to cover the whole screen (taking `display/window/stretch/aspect` into account). This means that everything is rendered directly at the target resolution. 3D is unaffected, while in 2D, there is no longer a 1:1 correspondence between sprite pixels and screen pixels, which may result in scaling artifacts. Recommended for most games that don't use a pixel art aesthetic, although it is possible to use this stretch mode for pixel art games too (especially in 3D). This is the default for projects created starting in Godot 4.7.
`"viewport"`: The size of the root `Viewport` is set precisely to the base size specified in the Project Settings' Display section. The scene is rendered to this viewport first. Finally, this viewport is scaled to fit the screen (taking `display/window/stretch/aspect` into account). Recommended for games that use a pixel art aesthetic.

> property display/window/stretch/scale : float ; default=1.0

The scale factor multiplier to use for 2D elements. This multiplies the final scale factor determined by `display/window/stretch/mode`. If using the **Disabled** stretch mode, this scale factor is applied as-is. This can be adjusted to make the UI easier to read on certain displays.

> property display/window/stretch/scale_mode : String ; default="fractional"

The policy to use to determine the final scale factor for 2D elements. This affects how `display/window/stretch/scale` is applied, in addition to the automatic scale factor determined by `display/window/stretch/mode`.
`"fractional"`: The scale factor will not be modified.
`"integer"`: The scale factor will be floored to an integer value, which means that the screen size will always be an integer multiple of the base viewport size. This provides a crisp pixel art appearance.
**Note:** When using integer scaling with a stretch mode, resizing the window to be smaller than the base viewport size will clip the contents. Consider preventing that by setting `Window.min_size` to the same value as the base viewport size defined in `display/window/size/viewport_width` and `display/window/size/viewport_height`.

> property display/window/subwindows/embed_subwindows : bool ; default=true

If `true`, subwindows are embedded in the main window (this is also called single-window mode). Single-window mode can be faster as it does not need to create a separate window for every popup and tooltip, which can be a slow operation depending on the operating system and rendering method in use.
If `false`, subwindows are created as separate windows (this is also called multi-window mode). This allows them to be moved outside the main window and use native operating system window decorations.
This is equivalent to `EditorSettings.interface/editor/display/single_window_mode` in the editor.

> property display/window/vsync/vsync_mode : int ; default=1

Sets the V-Sync mode for the main game window. The editor's own V-Sync mode can be set using `EditorSettings.interface/editor/display/vsync_mode`.
See `DisplayServer.VSyncMode` for possible values and how they affect the behavior of your application.
Depending on the platform and rendering method, the engine will fall back to **Enabled** if the desired mode is not supported.
V-Sync can be disabled on the command line using the `--disable-vsync` [command line argument]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/editor/command_line_tutorial.html).
**Note:** The **Adaptive** and **Mailbox** V-Sync modes are only supported in the Forward+ and Mobile rendering methods, not Compatibility.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To change the V-Sync mode at runtime, call `DisplayServer.window_set_vsync_mode` instead.

> property dotnet/project/assembly_name : String ; default=""

Name of the .NET assembly. This name is used as the name of the `.csproj` and `.sln` files. By default, it's set to the name of the project (`application/config/name`) allowing to change it in the future without affecting the .NET assembly.

> property dotnet/project/assembly_reload_attempts : int ; default=3

Number of times to attempt assembly reloading after rebuilding .NET assemblies. Effectively also the timeout in seconds to wait for unloading of script assemblies to finish.

> property dotnet/project/solution_directory : String ; default=""

Directory that contains the `.sln` file. By default, the `.sln` files is in the root of the project directory, next to the `project.godot` and `.csproj` files.
Changing this value allows setting up a multi-project scenario where there are multiple `.csproj`. Keep in mind that the Godot project is considered one of the C# projects in the workspace and it's root directory should contain the `project.godot` and `.csproj` next to each other.

> property editor/export/convert_text_resources_to_binary : bool ; default=true

If `true`, text resource (`tres`) and text scene (`tscn`) files are converted to their corresponding binary format on export. This decreases file sizes and speeds up loading slightly.
**Note:** Because a resource's file extension may change in an exported project, it is heavily recommended to use `@GDScript.load` or `ResourceLoader` instead of `FileAccess` to load resources dynamically.
**Note:** The project settings file (`project.godot`) will always be converted to binary on export, regardless of this setting.

> property editor/import/atlas_max_width : int ; default=2048

The maximum width to use when importing textures as an atlas. The value will be rounded to the nearest power of two when used. Use this to prevent imported textures from growing too large in the other direction.

> property editor/import/reimport_missing_imported_files : bool ; default=true

> property editor/import/use_multiple_threads : bool ; default=true

If `true` importing of resources is run on multiple threads.

> property editor/movie_writer/audio_bit_depth : int ; default=16

Number of bits per audio sample written to the `.avi` file. Only 16 and 32-bit are supported.

> property editor/movie_writer/disable_vsync : bool ; default=false

If `true`, requests V-Sync to be disabled when writing a movie (similar to setting `display/window/vsync/vsync_mode` to **Disabled**). This can speed up video writing if the hardware is fast enough to render, encode and save the video at a framerate higher than the monitor's refresh rate.
**Note:** `editor/movie_writer/disable_vsync` has no effect if the operating system or graphics driver forces V-Sync with no way for applications to disable it.

> property editor/movie_writer/fps : int ; default=60

The number of frames per second to record in the video when writing a movie. Simulation speed will adjust to always match the specified framerate, which means the engine will appear to run slower at higher `editor/movie_writer/fps` values. Certain FPS values will require you to adjust `editor/movie_writer/mix_rate` to prevent audio from desynchronizing over time.
This can be specified manually on the command line using the `--fixed-fps <fps>` [command line argument]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/editor/command_line_tutorial.html).

> property editor/movie_writer/mix_rate : int ; default=48000

The audio mix rate to use in the recorded audio when writing a movie (in Hz). This can be different from `audio/driver/mix_rate`, but this value must be divisible by `editor/movie_writer/fps` to prevent audio from desynchronizing over time.

> property editor/movie_writer/movie_file : String ; default=""

The output path for the movie. The file extension determines the `MovieWriter` that will be used.
Godot has 3 built-in `MovieWriter`s:
- OGV container with Theora for video and Vorbis for audio (`.ogv` file extension). Lossy compression, medium file sizes, fast encoding. The lossy compression quality can be adjusted by changing `ProjectSettings.editor/movie_writer/video_quality` and `ProjectSettings.editor/movie_writer/ogv/audio_quality`. The resulting file can be viewed in Godot with `VideoStreamPlayer` and most video players, but not web browsers as they don't support Theora.
- AVI container with MJPEG for video and uncompressed audio (`.avi` file extension). Lossy compression, medium file sizes, fast encoding. The lossy compression quality can be adjusted by changing `ProjectSettings.editor/movie_writer/video_quality`. The resulting file can be viewed in most video players, but it must be converted to another format for viewing on the web or by Godot with `VideoStreamPlayer`. MJPEG does not support transparency. AVI output is currently limited to a file of 4 GB in size at most.
- PNG image sequence for video and WAV for audio (`.png` file extension). Lossless compression, large file sizes, slow encoding. Designed to be encoded to a video file with another tool such as [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) after recording. Transparency is currently not supported, even if the root viewport is set to be transparent.
If you need to encode to a different format or pipe a stream through third-party software, you can extend this `MovieWriter` class to create your own movie writers.
When using PNG output, the frame number will be appended at the end of the file name. It starts from 0 and is padded with 8 digits to ensure correct sorting and easier processing. For example, if the output path is `/tmp/hello.png`, the first two frames will be `/tmp/hello00000000.png` and `/tmp/hello00000001.png`. The audio will be saved at `/tmp/hello.wav`.

> property editor/movie_writer/ogv/audio_quality : float ; default=0.5

The audio encoding quality to use when writing Vorbis audio to a file, between `-0.1` and `1.0` (inclusive). Higher `quality` values result in better-sounding output at the cost of larger file sizes. Even at quality `1.0`, compression remains lossy.
**Note:** This does not affect video quality, which is controlled by `editor/movie_writer/video_quality` instead.

> property editor/movie_writer/ogv/encoding_speed : int ; default=4

The tradeoff between encoding speed and compression efficiency. Speed `1` is the slowest but provides the best compression. Speed `4` is the fastest but provides the worst compression. Video quality is generally not affected significantly by this setting.

> property editor/movie_writer/ogv/keyframe_interval : int ; default=64

Forces keyframes at the specified interval (in frame count). Higher values can improve compression up to a certain level at the expense of higher latency when seeking.

> property editor/movie_writer/speaker_mode : int ; default=0

The speaker mode to use in the recorded audio when writing a movie. See `AudioServer.SpeakerMode` for possible values.

> property editor/movie_writer/video_quality : float ; default=0.75

The video encoding quality to use when writing a Theora or AVI (MJPEG) video to a file, between `0.0` and `1.0` (inclusive). Higher `quality` values result in better-looking output at the cost of larger file sizes. Recommended `quality` values are between `0.75` and `0.9`. Even at quality `1.0`, compression remains lossy.

> property editor/naming/default_signal_callback_name : String ; default="_on_{node_name}_{signal_name}"

The format of the default signal callback name (in the Signal Connection Dialog). The following substitutions are available: `{NodeName}`, `{nodeName}`, `{node_name}`, `{SignalName}`, `{signalName}`, and `{signal_name}`.

> property editor/naming/default_signal_callback_to_self_name : String ; default="_on_{signal_name}"

The format of the default signal callback name when a signal connects to the same node that emits it (in the Signal Connection Dialog). The following substitutions are available: `{NodeName}`, `{nodeName}`, `{node_name}`, `{SignalName}`, `{signalName}`, and `{signal_name}`.

> property editor/naming/node_name_casing : int ; default=0

When creating node names automatically, set the type of casing to use in this project. This is mostly an editor setting.

> property editor/naming/node_name_num_separator : int ; default=0

What to use to separate node name from number. This is mostly an editor setting.

> property editor/naming/scene_name_casing : int ; default=2

When generating scene file names from scene root node, set the type of casing to use in this project. This is mostly an editor setting.

> property editor/naming/script_name_casing : int ; default=0

When generating script file names from the selected node, set the type of casing to use in this project. This is mostly an editor setting.

> property editor/run/main_run_args : String ; default=""

The command-line arguments to append to Godot's own command line when running the project. This doesn't affect the editor itself.
It is possible to make another executable run Godot by using the `%command%` placeholder. The placeholder will be replaced with Godot's own command line. Program-specific arguments should be placed *before* the placeholder, whereas Godot-specific arguments should be placed *after* the placeholder.
For example, this can be used to force the project to run on the dedicated GPU in an NVIDIA Optimus system on Linux:

```text
            prime-run %command%

```

> property editor/script/search_in_file_extensions : PackedStringArray

Text-based file extensions to include in the script editor's "Find in Files" feature. You can add e.g. `tscn` if you wish to also parse your scene files, especially if you use built-in scripts which are serialized in the scene files.

> property editor/script/templates_search_path : String ; default="res://script_templates"

Search path for project-specific script templates. Godot will search for script templates both in the editor-specific path and in this project-specific path.

> property editor/version_control/autoload_on_startup : bool ; default=false

> property editor/version_control/plugin_name : String ; default=""

> property filesystem/import/blender/enabled : bool ; default=true

If `true`, Blender 3D scene files with the `.blend` extension will be imported by converting them to glTF 2.0.
This requires configuring a path to a Blender executable in the `EditorSettings.filesystem/import/blender/blender_path` setting. Blender 3.0 or later is required.

> property filesystem/import/blender/enabled.android : bool ; default=false

Override for `filesystem/import/blender/enabled` on Android where Blender can't easily be accessed from Godot.

> property filesystem/import/blender/enabled.web : bool ; default=false

Override for `filesystem/import/blender/enabled` on the Web where Blender can't easily be accessed from Godot.

> property filesystem/import/fbx2gltf/enabled : bool ; default=true

If `true`, Autodesk FBX 3D scene files with the `.fbx` extension will be imported by converting them to glTF 2.0.
This requires configuring a path to an FBX2glTF executable in the editor settings at `EditorSettings.filesystem/import/fbx/fbx2gltf_path`.

> property filesystem/import/fbx2gltf/enabled.android : bool ; default=false

Override for `filesystem/import/fbx2gltf/enabled` on Android where FBX2glTF can't easily be accessed from Godot.

> property filesystem/import/fbx2gltf/enabled.web : bool ; default=false

Override for `filesystem/import/fbx2gltf/enabled` on the Web where FBX2glTF can't easily be accessed from Godot.

> property gui/common/default_scroll_deadzone : int ; default=0

Default value for `ScrollContainer.scroll_deadzone`, which will be used for all `ScrollContainer`s unless overridden.

> property gui/common/drag_threshold : int ; default=10

The minimum distance the mouse cursor must move while pressed before a drag operation begins in the default viewport. For custom viewports see `Viewport.gui_drag_threshold`.

> property gui/common/show_focus_state_on_pointer_event : int ; default=1

Determines whether a `Control` should visually indicate focus when that focus is gained using a mouse or touch input.
- **Never** (`0`) show the focused state for mouse/touch input.
- **Text Input Controls** (`1`) show the focused state even if that focus was gained via mouse/touch input (similar to browser behavior).
- **Always** (`2`) show the focused state, even if that focus was gained via mouse/touch input.

> property gui/common/snap_controls_to_pixels : bool ; default=true

If `true`, snaps `Control` node vertices to the nearest pixel to ensure they remain crisp even when the camera moves or zooms.

> property gui/common/swap_cancel_ok : int ; default=0

How to position the Cancel and OK buttons in the project's `AcceptDialog` windows. Different platforms have different conventions for this, which can be overridden through this setting.
- **Auto** follows the platform convention: OK first on Windows, KDE, and LXQt; Cancel first on macOS and other Linux desktop environments.
- **Cancel First** forces the Cancel/OK ordering.
- **OK First** forces the OK/Cancel ordering.
To check if these buttons are swapped at runtime, use `DisplayServer.get_swap_cancel_ok`.
**Note:** This doesn't affect native dialogs such as the ones spawned by `DisplayServer.dialog_show`.

> property gui/common/text_edit_undo_stack_max_size : int ; default=1024

Maximum undo/redo history size for `TextEdit` fields.

> property gui/fonts/dynamic_fonts/use_oversampling : bool ; default=true

If set to `true` and `display/window/stretch/mode` is set to `"canvas_items"`, font and `DPITexture` oversampling is enabled in the main window. Use `Viewport.oversampling` to control oversampling in other viewports and windows.

> property gui/theme/custom : String ; default=""

Path to a custom `Theme` resource file to use for the project (`.theme` or generic `.tres`/`.res` extension).

> property gui/theme/custom_font : String ; default=""

Path to a custom `Font` resource to use as default for all GUI elements of the project.

> property gui/theme/default_font_antialiasing : int ; default=1

Font anti-aliasing mode for the default project font. See `FontFile.antialiasing`.
**Note:** This setting does not affect custom `Font`s used within the project. Use the **Import** dock for that instead (see `ResourceImporterDynamicFont.antialiasing`).

> property gui/theme/default_font_generate_mipmaps : bool ; default=false

If set to `true`, the default font will have mipmaps generated. This prevents text from looking grainy when a `Control` is scaled down, or when a `Label3D` is viewed from a long distance (if `Label3D.texture_filter` is set to a mode that displays mipmaps).
Enabling `gui/theme/default_font_generate_mipmaps` increases font generation time and memory usage. Only enable this setting if you actually need it.
**Note:** This setting does not affect custom `Font`s used within the project. Use the **Import** dock for that instead (see `ResourceImporterDynamicFont.generate_mipmaps`).

> property gui/theme/default_font_hinting : int ; default=1

Font hinting mode for the default project font. See `FontFile.hinting`.
**Note:** This setting does not affect custom `Font`s used within the project. Use the **Import** dock for that instead (see `ResourceImporterDynamicFont.hinting`).

> property gui/theme/default_font_multichannel_signed_distance_field : bool ; default=false

If set to `true`, the default font will use multichannel signed distance field (MSDF) for crisp rendering at any size. Since this approach does not rely on rasterizing the font every time its size changes, this allows for resizing the font in real-time without any performance penalty. Text will also not look grainy for `Control`s that are scaled down (or for `Label3D`s viewed from a long distance).
MSDF font rendering can be combined with `gui/theme/default_font_generate_mipmaps` to further improve font rendering quality when scaled down.
**Note:** This setting does not affect custom `Font`s used within the project. Use the **Import** dock for that instead (see `ResourceImporterDynamicFont.multichannel_signed_distance_field`).

> property gui/theme/default_font_subpixel_positioning : int ; default=1

Font glyph subpixel positioning mode for the default project font. See `FontFile.subpixel_positioning`.
**Note:** This setting does not affect custom `Font`s used within the project. Use the **Import** dock for that instead (see `ResourceImporterDynamicFont.subpixel_positioning`).

> property gui/theme/default_theme_scale : float ; default=1.0

The default scale factor for `Control`s, when not overridden by a `Theme`.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To change the default theme scale at runtime, set `ThemeDB.fallback_base_scale` instead. However, to adjust the scale of all 2D elements at runtime, it's preferable to use `Window.content_scale_factor` on the root `Window` node instead (as this also affects overridden `Theme`s). See [Multiple resolutions]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/rendering/multiple_resolutions.html) in the documentation for details.

> property gui/theme/lcd_subpixel_layout : int ; default=1

LCD subpixel layout used for font anti-aliasing. See `TextServer.FontLCDSubpixelLayout`.

> property gui/timers/button_shortcut_feedback_highlight_time : float ; default=0.2

When `BaseButton.shortcut_feedback` is enabled, this is the time the `BaseButton` will remain highlighted after a shortcut. This duration is not affected by `Engine.time_scale`.

> property gui/timers/incremental_search_max_interval_msec : int ; default=2000

Timer setting for incremental search in `Tree`, `ItemList`, etc. controls (in milliseconds).

> property gui/timers/text_edit_idle_detect_sec : float ; default=3

Timer for detecting idle in `TextEdit` (in seconds).

> property gui/timers/tooltip_delay_sec : float ; default=0.5

Default delay for tooltips (in seconds).

> property gui/timers/tooltip_delay_sec.editor_hint : float ; default=0.5

Delay for tooltips in the editor.

> property input/ui_accept : Dictionary

Default `InputEventAction` to confirm a focused button, menu or list item, or validate input.
**Note:** Default `ui_*` actions cannot be removed as they are necessary for the internal logic of several `Control`s. The events assigned to the action can however be modified.

> property input/ui_accessibility_drag_and_drop : Dictionary

Default `InputEventAction` to start or end a drag-and-drop operation without using mouse.
**Note:** Default `ui_*` actions cannot be removed as they are necessary for the internal logic of several `Control`s. The events assigned to the action can however be modified.

> property input/ui_cancel : Dictionary

Default `InputEventAction` to discard a modal or pending input.
**Note:** Default `ui_*` actions cannot be removed as they are necessary for the internal logic of several `Control`s. The events assigned to the action can however be modified.

> property input/ui_close_dialog : Dictionary

Default `InputEventAction` to close a dialog window.
**Note:** Default `ui_*` actions cannot be removed as they are necessary for the internal logic of several `Control`s. The events assigned to the action can however be modified.

> property input/ui_close_dialog.macos : Dictionary

macOS specific override for the shortcut to close a dialog window.

> property input/ui_colorpicker_delete_preset : Dictionary

Default `InputEventAction` to delete a color preset in a `ColorPicker`.
**Note:** Default `ui_*` actions cannot be removed as they are necessary for the internal logic of several `Control`s. The events assigned to the action can however be modified.

> property input/ui_copy : Dictionary

Default `InputEventAction` to copy a selection to the clipboard.
**Note:** Default `ui_*` actions cannot be removed as they are necessary for the internal logic of several `Control`s. The events assigned to the action can however be modified.

> property input/ui_cut : Dictionary

Default `InputEventAction` to cut a selection to the clipboard.
**Note:** Default `ui_*` actions cannot be removed as they are necessary for the internal logic of several `Control`s. The events assigned to the action can however be modified.

> property input/ui_down : Dictionary

Default `InputEventAction` to move down in the UI.

> property navigation/world/map_use_async_iterations : bool ; default=true

If enabled, navigation map synchronization uses an async process that runs on a background thread. This avoids stalling the main thread but adds an additional delay to any navigation map change.

> property navigation/world/region_use_async_iterations : bool ; default=true

> property physics/2d/default_angular_damp : float ; default=1.0

The default rotational motion damping in 2D. Damping is used to gradually slow down physical objects over time. RigidBodies will fall back to this value when combining their own damping values and no area damping value is present.
Suggested values are in the range `0` to `30`. At value `0` objects will keep moving with the same velocity. Greater values will stop the object faster. A value equal to or greater than the physics tick rate (`physics/common/physics_ticks_per_second`) will bring the object to a stop in one iteration.
**Note:** Godot damping calculations are velocity-dependent, meaning bodies moving faster will take a longer time to come to rest. They do not simulate inertia, friction, or air resistance. Therefore heavier or larger bodies will lose speed at the same proportional rate as lighter or smaller bodies.
During each physics tick, Godot will multiply the linear velocity of RigidBodies by `1.0 - combined_damp / physics_ticks_per_second`. By default, bodies combine damp factors: `combined_damp` is the sum of the damp value of the body and this value or the area's value the body is in. See `RigidBody2D.DampMode`.
**Warning:** Godot's damping calculations are simulation tick rate dependent. Changing `physics/common/physics_ticks_per_second` may significantly change the outcomes and feel of your simulation. This is true for the entire range of damping values greater than 0. To get back to a similar feel, you also need to change your damp values. This needed change is not proportional and differs from case to case.

> property physics/2d/default_gravity : float ; default=980.0

```csharp
            // Set the default gravity strength to 980.

> property physics/2d/default_linear_damp : float ; default=0.1

The default linear motion damping in 2D. Damping is used to gradually slow down physical objects over time. RigidBodies will fall back to this value when combining their own damping values and no area damping value is present.
Suggested values are in the range `0` to `30`. At value `0` objects will keep moving with the same velocity. Greater values will stop the object faster. A value equal to or greater than the physics tick rate (`physics/common/physics_ticks_per_second`) will bring the object to a stop in one iteration.

Therefore heavier or larger bodies will lose speed at the same proportional rate as lighter or smaller bodies.
During each physics tick, Godot will multiply the linear velocity of RigidBodies by `1.0 - combined_damp / physics_ticks_per_second`, where `combined_damp` is the sum of the linear damp of the body and this value, or the area's value the body is in, assuming the body defaults to combine damp values. See `RigidBody2D.DampMode`.
**Warning:** Godot's damping calculations are simulation tick rate dependent. Changing `physics/common/physics_ticks_per_second` may significantly change the outcomes and feel of your simulation. This is true for the entire range of damping values greater than 0. To get back to a similar feel, you also need to change your damp values.

The approach used for 3D scene traversal when physics interpolation is enabled.
- `DEFAULT`: The default optimized method.
- `Legacy`: The previous reference method used for scene tree traversal, which is slower.
- `Debug`: Swaps between `DEFAULT` and `Legacy` methods on alternating frames, and provides logging information (which in turn makes it slower). Intended for debugging only; you should use the `DEFAULT` method in most cases.

If `true`, the 3D physics server runs on a separate thread, making better use of multi-core CPUs. If `false`, the 3D physics server runs on the main thread. Running the physics server on a separate thread can increase performance, but restricts API access to only physics process.
**Note:** When `physics/3d/physics_engine` is set to `Jolt Physics`, enabling this setting will prevent the 3D physics server from being able to provide any context when reporting errors and warnings, and will instead always refer to nodes as `<unknown>`.

Threshold angular velocity under which a 3D physics body will be considered inactive. See `PhysicsServer3D.SPACE_PARAM_BODY_ANGULAR_VELOCITY_SLEEP_THRESHOLD`.
**Note:** This project setting is only effective when using GodotPhysics3D. It has no effect when using Jolt Physics.

> property physics/3d/sleep_threshold_linear : float ; default=0.1

Threshold linear velocity under which a 3D physics body will be considered inactive. See `PhysicsServer3D.SPACE_PARAM_BODY_LINEAR_VELOCITY_SLEEP_THRESHOLD`.
**Note:** This project setting is only effective when using GodotPhysics3D. It has no effect when using Jolt Physics.

> property physics/3d/solver/contact_max_allowed_penetration : float ; default=0.01

Maximum distance a shape can penetrate another shape before it is considered a collision. See `PhysicsServer3D.SPACE_PARAM_CONTACT_MAX_ALLOWED_PENETRATION`.
**Note:** This project setting is only effective when using GodotPhysics3D. It has no effect when using Jolt Physics.

> property physics/3d/solver/contact_max_separation : float ; default=0.05

Maximum distance a shape can be from another before they are considered separated and the contact is discarded. See `PhysicsServer3D.SPACE_PARAM_CONTACT_MAX_SEPARATION`.
**Note:** This project setting is only effective when using GodotPhysics3D. It has no effect when using Jolt Physics.

> property physics/3d/solver/contact_recycle_radius : float ; default=0.01

Maximum distance a pair of bodies has to move before their collision status has to be recalculated. See `PhysicsServer3D.SPACE_PARAM_CONTACT_RECYCLE_RADIUS`.
**Note:** This project setting is only effective when using GodotPhysics3D. It has no effect when using Jolt Physics.

> property physics/3d/solver/default_contact_bias : float ; default=0.8

Default solver bias for all physics contacts. Defines how much bodies react to enforce contact separation. See `PhysicsServer3D.SPACE_PARAM_CONTACT_DEFAULT_BIAS`.
Individual shapes can have a specific bias value (see `Shape3D.custom_solver_bias`).
**Note:** This project setting is only effective when using GodotPhysics3D. It has no effect when using Jolt Physics.

> property physics/3d/solver/solver_iterations : int ; default=16

Number of solver iterations for all contacts and constraints. The greater the number of iterations, the more accurate the collisions will be. However, a greater number of iterations requires more CPU power, which can decrease performance. See `PhysicsServer3D.SPACE_PARAM_SOLVER_ITERATIONS`.
**Note:** This project setting is only effective when using GodotPhysics3D. It has no effect when using Jolt Physics.

> property physics/3d/time_before_sleep : float ; default=0.5

Time (in seconds) of inactivity before which a 3D physics body will put to sleep. See `PhysicsServer3D.SPACE_PARAM_BODY_TIME_TO_SLEEP`.
**Note:** This project setting is only effective when using GodotPhysics3D. It has no effect when using Jolt Physics.

> property physics/common/enable_object_picking : bool ; default=true

Enables `Viewport.physics_object_picking` on the root viewport.

> property physics/common/max_physics_steps_per_frame : int ; default=8

Controls the maximum number of physics steps that can be simulated each rendered frame. The default value is tuned to avoid situations where the framerate suddenly drops to a very low value beyond a certain amount of physics simulation. This occurs because the physics engine can't keep up with the expected simulation rate. In this case, the framerate will start dropping, but the engine is only allowed to simulate a certain number of physics steps per rendered frame. This snowballs into a situation where framerate keeps dropping until it reaches a very low framerate (typically 1-2 FPS) and is called the *physics spiral of death*.
However, the game will appear to slow down if the rendering FPS is less than `1 / max_physics_steps_per_frame` of `physics/common/physics_ticks_per_second`. This occurs even if `delta` is consistently used in physics calculations. To avoid this, increase `physics/common/max_physics_steps_per_frame` if you have increased `physics/common/physics_ticks_per_second` significantly above its default value.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To change the maximum number of simulated physics steps per frame at runtime, set `Engine.max_physics_steps_per_frame` instead.

> property physics/common/physics_interpolation : bool ; default=false

If `true`, the renderer will interpolate the transforms of objects (both physics and non-physics) between the last two transforms, so that smooth motion is seen even when physics ticks do not coincide with rendered frames. See also `Node.reset_physics_interpolation`.
**Note:** Although this is a global setting, finer control of individual branches of the `SceneTree` is possible using `Node.physics_interpolation_mode`.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To toggle physics interpolation at runtime, set `SceneTree.physics_interpolation` instead.
**Note:** Property `physics/common/physics_jitter_fix` is automatically disabled if `physics/common/physics_interpolation` is set to `true`, as the two methods are incompatible.

> property physics/common/physics_jitter_fix : float ; default=0.5

Controls how much physics ticks are synchronized with real time. For 0 or less, the ticks are synchronized. Such values are recommended for network games, where clock synchronization matters. Higher values cause higher deviation of in-game clock and real clock, but allows smoothing out framerate jitters. The default value of 0.5 should be good enough for most; values above 2 could cause the game to react to dropped frames with a noticeable delay and are not recommended.
**Note:** Jitter fix is automatically disabled at runtime when `physics/common/physics_interpolation` is enabled.
**Note:** When using a custom physics interpolation solution, the physics jitter fix should be disabled by setting `physics/common/physics_jitter_fix` to `0.0`.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To change the physics jitter fix at runtime, set `Engine.physics_jitter_fix` instead.

> property physics/common/physics_ticks_per_second : int ; default=60

The number of fixed iterations per second. This controls how often physics simulation and the `Node._physics_process` method are run.
CPU usage scales approximately with the physics tick rate. However, at very low tick rates (usually below 30), physics behavior can break down. Input can also become less responsive at low tick rates as there can be a gap between input being registered, and the response on the next physics tick. High tick rates give more accurate physics simulation, particularly for fast moving objects. For example, racing games may benefit from increasing the tick rate above the default 60.
See also `application/run/max_fps`.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To change the physics FPS at runtime, set `Engine.physics_ticks_per_second` instead.
**Note:** Only `physics/common/max_physics_steps_per_frame` physics ticks may be simulated per rendered frame at most. If more physics ticks have to be simulated per rendered frame to keep up with rendering, the project will appear to slow down (even if `delta` is used consistently in physics calculations). Therefore, it is recommended to also increase `physics/common/max_physics_steps_per_frame` if increasing `physics/common/physics_ticks_per_second` significantly above its default value.
**Note:** Consider enabling [physics interpolation]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/physics/interpolation/index.html) if you change `physics/common/physics_ticks_per_second` to a value that is not a multiple of `60`. Using physics interpolation will avoid jittering when the monitor refresh rate and physics update rate don't exactly match.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/collisions/active_edge_threshold : float ; default=0.87266463

The maximum angle, in radians, between two adjacent triangles in a `ConcavePolygonShape3D` or `HeightMapShape3D` for which the edge between those triangles is considered inactive.
Collisions against an inactive edge will have its normal overridden to instead be the surface normal of the triangle. This can help alleviate ghost collisions.
**Note:** Setting this too high can result in objects not depenetrating properly.
**Note:** This applies to all shape queries, as well as physics bodies within the simulation.
**Note:** This does not apply when enabling Jolt's enhanced internal edge removal, which supersedes this.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/collisions/collision_margin_fraction : float ; default=0.08

The amount of collision margin to use for certain convex collision shapes, such as `BoxShape3D`, `CylinderShape3D` and `ConvexPolygonShape3D`, as a fraction of the shape's shortest axis, with `Shape3D.margin` as the upper bound. This is mainly used to speed up collision detection with convex shapes.
**Note:** Collision margins in Jolt do not add any extra size to the shape. Instead the shape is first shrunk by the margin and then expanded by the same amount, resulting in a shape with rounded corners.
**Note:** Setting this value too close to `0.0` may also negatively affect the accuracy of the collision detection with convex shapes.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/joints/world_node : int ; default=0

Which of the two nodes bound by a joint should represent the world when one of the two is omitted, as either `Joint3D.node_a` or `Joint3D.node_b`. This can be thought of as having the omitted node be a `StaticBody3D` at the joint's position. Joint limits are more easily expressed when `Joint3D.node_a` represents the world.
**Note:** In Godot Physics, only `Joint3D.node_b` can represent the world.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/limits/max_angular_velocity : float ; default=47.12389

The maximum angular velocity that a `RigidBody3D` can reach, in radians per second.
This is mainly used as a fail-safe, to prevent the simulation from exploding, as fast-moving objects colliding with complex physics structures can otherwise cause them to go out of control. Fast-moving objects can also cause a lot of stress on the collision detection system, which can slow down the simulation considerably.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/limits/max_bodies : int ; default=10240

The maximum number of `PhysicsBody3D` to support at the same time, awake or sleeping. When this limit is exceeded, an error is reported and anything past that point is undefined behavior.
**Note:** This limit also applies within the editor.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/limits/max_body_pairs : int ; default=65536

The maximum number of body pairs to allow processing of. When this limit is exceeded, a warning is reported and collisions will randomly be ignored while bodies pass through each other.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/limits/max_contact_constraints : int ; default=20480

The maximum number of contact constraints to allow processing of. When this limit is exceeded, a warning is reported and collisions will randomly be ignored while bodies pass through each other.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/limits/max_linear_velocity : float ; default=500.0

The maximum linear velocity that a `RigidBody3D` can reach, in meters per second.
This is mainly used as a fail-safe, to prevent the simulation from exploding, as fast-moving objects colliding with complex physics structures can otherwise cause them to go out of control. Fast-moving objects can also cause a lot of stress on the collision detection system, which can slow down the simulation considerably.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/limits/temporary_memory_buffer_size : int ; default=32

The amount of memory to pre-allocate for the stack allocator used within Jolt, in MiB. This allocator is used within the physics step to store things that are only needed during it, like which bodies are in contact, how they form islands and the data needed to solve the contacts.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/limits/world_boundary_shape_size : float ; default=2000.0

The size of `WorldBoundaryShape3D` boundaries, for all three dimensions. The plane is effectively centered within a box of this size, and anything outside of the box will not collide with it. This is necessary as `WorldBoundaryShape3D` is not unbounded when using Jolt, in order to prevent precision issues.
**Note:** Setting this value too high can make collision detection less accurate.
**Note:** Collisions against the effective edges of a `WorldBoundaryShape3D` will be inconsistent.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/motion_queries/recovery_amount : float ; default=0.4

Fraction of the total penetration to depenetrate per iteration during motion queries.
**Note:** This affects methods `CharacterBody3D.move_and_slide`, `PhysicsBody3D.move_and_collide`, `PhysicsBody3D.test_move` and `PhysicsServer3D.body_test_motion`.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/motion_queries/recovery_iterations : int ; default=4

The number of iterations to run when depenetrating during motion queries.
**Note:** This affects methods `CharacterBody3D.move_and_slide`, `PhysicsBody3D.move_and_collide`, `PhysicsBody3D.test_move` and `PhysicsServer3D.body_test_motion`.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/motion_queries/use_enhanced_internal_edge_removal : bool ; default=true

If `true`, enables Jolt's enhanced internal edge removal during motion queries. This can help alleviate ghost collisions, but only with edges within a single body, meaning edges between separate bodies can still cause ghost collisions.
**Note:** This affects methods `CharacterBody3D.move_and_slide`, `PhysicsBody3D.move_and_collide`, `PhysicsBody3D.test_move` and `PhysicsServer3D.body_test_motion`.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/queries/enable_ray_cast_face_index : bool ; default=false

If `true`, populates the `face_index` field in the results of `PhysicsDirectSpaceState3D.intersect_ray`, also accessed through `RayCast3D.get_collision_face_index`. If `false`, the `face_index` field will be left at its default value of `-1`.
**Note:** Enabling this setting will increase Jolt's memory usage for `ConcavePolygonShape3D` by around 25%.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/queries/use_enhanced_internal_edge_removal : bool ; default=false

If `true`, enables Jolt's enhanced internal edge removal during shape queries. This can help alleviate ghost collisions when using shape queries for things like character movement, but only with edges within a single body, meaning edges between separate bodies can still cause ghost collisions.
**Note:** This affects methods `PhysicsDirectSpaceState3D.cast_motion`, `PhysicsDirectSpaceState3D.collide_shape`, `PhysicsDirectSpaceState3D.get_rest_info` and `PhysicsDirectSpaceState3D.intersect_shape`.
**Note:** Enabling this setting can cause certain shapes to be culled from the results entirely, but you will get at least one intersection per body.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/allow_sleep : bool ; default=true

If `true`, `RigidBody3D` nodes are allowed to go to sleep if their velocity is below the threshold defined in `physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/sleep_velocity_threshold` for the duration set in `physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/sleep_time_threshold`. This can improve physics simulation performance when there are non-moving `RigidBody3D` nodes, at the cost of some nodes possibly failing to wake up in certain scenarios. Consider disabling this temporarily to troubleshoot `RigidBody3D` nodes not moving when they should.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/baumgarte_stabilization_factor : float ; default=0.2

How much of the position error of a `RigidBody3D` to fix during a physics step, where `0.0` is none and `1.0` is the full amount. This affects things like how quickly bodies depenetrate.
**Note:** Setting this value too high can make `RigidBody3D` nodes unstable.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/body_pair_contact_cache_angle_threshold : float ; default=0.034906585

The maximum relative angle by which a body pair can move and still reuse the collision results from the previous physics step, in radians.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/body_pair_contact_cache_distance_threshold : float ; default=0.001

The maximum relative distance by which a body pair can move and still reuse the collision results from the previous physics step, in meters.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/body_pair_contact_cache_enabled : bool ; default=true

If `true`, enables the body pair contact cache, which removes the need for potentially expensive collision detection when the relative orientation between two bodies hasn't changed much.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/bounce_velocity_threshold : float ; default=1.0

The minimum velocity needed before a collision can be bouncy, in meters per second.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/continuous_cd_max_penetration : float ; default=0.25

Fraction of a body's inner radius that may penetrate another body while using continuous collision detection.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/continuous_cd_movement_threshold : float ; default=0.75

Fraction of a body's inner radius that the body must move per step to make use of continuous collision detection.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/generate_all_kinematic_contacts : bool ; default=false

If `true`, a `RigidBody3D` frozen with `RigidBody3D.FREEZE_MODE_KINEMATIC` is able to collide with other kinematic and static bodies, and therefore generate contacts for them.
**Note:** This setting can come at a heavy CPU and memory cost if you allow many/large frozen kinematic bodies with a non-zero `RigidBody3D.max_contacts_reported` to overlap with complex static geometry, such as `ConcavePolygonShape3D` or `HeightMapShape3D`.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/penetration_slop : float ; default=0.02

How much bodies are allowed to penetrate each other, in meters.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/position_steps : int ; default=2

Number of solver position iterations. The greater the number of iterations, the more accurate the simulation will be, at the cost of CPU performance.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/sleep_time_threshold : float ; default=0.5

Time in seconds a `RigidBody3D` will spend below the sleep velocity threshold before going to sleep.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/sleep_velocity_threshold : float ; default=0.03

The linear velocity of specific points on the bounding box of a `RigidBody3D`, below which it can be put to sleep, in meters per second. These points help capture both the linear and angular motion of a `RigidBody3D`.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/soft_body_point_radius : float ; default=0.01

How big the points of a `SoftBody3D` are, in meters. A higher value can prevent behavior such as cloth laying perfectly flush against other surfaces and causing Z-fighting.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/speculative_contact_distance : float ; default=0.02

Radius around physics bodies, inside which speculative contact points will be detected, in meters. This is mainly used to prevent tunneling/penetration for `RigidBody3D` nodes during simulation.
**Note:** Setting this too high may result in ghost collisions, as speculative contacts are based on the closest points during the collision detection step which may not be the actual closest points by the time the two bodies hit.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/use_enhanced_internal_edge_removal : bool ; default=true

If `true`, enables Jolt's enhanced internal edge removal for `RigidBody3D`. This can help alleviate ghost collisions when, for example, a `RigidBody3D` collides with the edges of two perfectly joined `BoxShape3D`. The removal only applies to edges internal to a single body, meaning edges between separate bodies can still cause ghost collisions.

> property physics/jolt_physics_3d/simulation/velocity_steps : int ; default=10

Number of solver velocity iterations. The greater the number of iterations, the more accurate the simulation will be, at the cost of CPU performance.
**Note:** This needs to be at least `2` in order for friction to work, as friction is applied using the non-penetration impulse from the previous iteration.

> property rendering/2d/batching/item_buffer_size : int ; default=16384

Maximum number of canvas item commands that can be batched into a single draw call.

> property rendering/2d/batching/uniform_set_cache_size : int ; default=4096

Maximum number of uniform sets that will be cached by the 2D renderer when batching draw calls.
**Note:** Increasing this value can improve performance if the project renders many unique sprite textures every frame.

> property rendering/2d/sdf/oversize : int ; default=1

Controls how much of the original viewport size should be covered by the 2D signed distance field. This SDF can be sampled in `CanvasItem` shaders and is used for `GPUParticles2D` collision. Higher values allow portions of occluders located outside the viewport to still be taken into account in the generated signed distance field, at the cost of performance. If you notice particles falling through `LightOccluder2D`s as the occluders leave the viewport, increase this setting.
The percentage specified is added on each axis and on both sides. For example, with the default setting of 120%, the signed distance field will cover 20% of the viewport's size outside the viewport on each side (top, right, bottom, left).
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To change the 2D SDF oversizing percentage at runtime, use `RenderingServer.viewport_set_sdf_oversize_and_scale` instead.

> property rendering/2d/sdf/scale : int ; default=1

The resolution scale to use for the 2D signed distance field. Higher values lead to a more precise and more stable signed distance field as the camera moves, at the cost of performance. The default value (50%) renders at half the resolution of the viewport size on each axis, which means the SDF is generated with 25% of the viewport's pixel count.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To change the 2D SDF resolution scale at runtime, use `RenderingServer.viewport_set_sdf_oversize_and_scale` instead.

> property rendering/2d/shadow_atlas/size : int ; default=2048

The size of the 2D shadow atlas in pixels. Higher values result in more precise `Light2D` shadows, at the cost of performance and video memory usage. The specified value is rounded up to the nearest power of 2.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To change the 2D shadow atlas size at runtime, use `RenderingServer.canvas_set_shadow_texture_size` instead.

> property rendering/2d/snap/snap_2d_transforms_to_pixel : bool ; default=false

If `true`, `CanvasItem` nodes will internally snap to full pixels. Useful for low-resolution pixel art games. Their position can still be sub-pixel, but the decimals will not have effect as the position is rounded. This can lead to a crisper appearance at the cost of less smooth movement, especially when `Camera2D` smoothing is enabled.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To toggle 2D transform snapping at runtime, use `RenderingServer.viewport_set_snap_2d_transforms_to_pixel` on the root `Viewport` instead.
**Note:** `Control` nodes are snapped to the nearest pixel by default. This is controlled by `gui/common/snap_controls_to_pixels`.
**Note:** It is not recommended to use this setting together with `rendering/2d/snap/snap_2d_vertices_to_pixel`, as movement may appear even less smooth. Prefer only enabling this setting instead.

> property rendering/2d/snap/snap_2d_vertices_to_pixel : bool ; default=false

If `true`, vertices of `CanvasItem` nodes will snap to full pixels. Useful for low-resolution pixel art games. Only affects the final vertex positions, not the transforms. This can lead to a crisper appearance at the cost of less smooth movement, especially when `Camera2D` smoothing is enabled.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To toggle 2D vertex snapping at runtime, use `RenderingServer.viewport_set_snap_2d_vertices_to_pixel` on the root `Viewport` instead.
**Note:** `Control` nodes are snapped to the nearest pixel by default. This is controlled by `gui/common/snap_controls_to_pixels`.
**Note:** It is not recommended to use this setting together with `rendering/2d/snap/snap_2d_transforms_to_pixel`, as movement may appear even less smooth. Prefer only enabling that setting instead.

> property rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/msaa_2d : int ; default=0

Sets the number of multisample antialiasing (MSAA) samples to use for 2D/Canvas rendering (as a power of two). MSAA is used to reduce aliasing around the edges of polygons. A higher MSAA value results in smoother edges but can be significantly slower on some hardware, especially integrated graphics due to their limited memory bandwidth. This has no effect on shader-induced aliasing or texture aliasing.
**Note:** MSAA is only supported in the Forward+ and Mobile rendering methods, not Compatibility.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To set the number of 2D MSAA samples at runtime, set `Viewport.msaa_2d` or use `RenderingServer.viewport_set_msaa_2d`.

> property rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/msaa_3d : int ; default=0

Sets the number of multisample antialiasing (MSAA) samples to use for 3D rendering (as a power of two). MSAA is used to reduce aliasing around the edges of polygons. A higher MSAA value results in smoother edges but can be significantly slower on some hardware, especially integrated graphics due to their limited memory bandwidth. See also `rendering/scaling_3d/mode` for supersampling, which provides higher quality but is much more expensive. This has no effect on shader-induced aliasing or texture aliasing.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To set the number of 3D MSAA samples at runtime, set `Viewport.msaa_3d` or use `RenderingServer.viewport_set_msaa_3d`.

> property rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/screen_space_aa : int ; default=0

Sets the screen-space antialiasing mode for the default screen `Viewport`. Screen-space antialiasing works by selectively blurring edges in a post-process shader. It differs from MSAA which takes multiple coverage samples while rendering objects. Screen-space AA methods are typically faster than MSAA and will smooth out specular aliasing, but tend to make scenes appear blurry. The blurriness is partially counteracted by automatically using a negative mipmap LOD bias (see `rendering/textures/default_filters/texture_mipmap_bias`).
Another way to combat specular aliasing is to enable `rendering/anti_aliasing/screen_space_roughness_limiter/enabled`.
**Note:** Screen-space antialiasing is only supported in the Forward+ and Mobile rendering methods, not Compatibility.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To set the screen-space antialiasing mode at runtime, set `Viewport.screen_space_aa` on the root `Viewport` instead, or use `RenderingServer.viewport_set_screen_space_aa`.

> property rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/smaa_edge_detection_threshold : float ; default=0.05

Sets the sensitivity to edges when using SMAA for antialiasing. Lower values will catch more edges, at a potentially higher performance cost.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. There is currently no way to change this setting at run-time.

> property rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/use_debanding : bool ; default=false

If `true`, uses a fast dithering filter just before transforming floating point color values to integer color values to make banding significantly less visible. Debanding is applied at different steps of the rendering process depending on the rendering method and `rendering/viewport/hdr_2d` setting.
In some cases, debanding may introduce a slightly noticeable dithering pattern. It's recommended to enable debanding only when actually needed since the dithering pattern will make lossless-compressed screenshots larger.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts and configures `RenderingServer.material_set_use_debanding` and `Viewport.use_debanding` of the root `Viewport`. When `rendering/viewport/hdr_2d` is disabled, you should additionally set the `Viewport.use_debanding` of other viewports in your project. To set debanding at run-time, the property that should be set depends on the renderer: Forward+ only uses `Viewport.use_debanding` and Mobile uses both `RenderingServer.material_set_use_debanding` and `Viewport.use_debanding`.

> property rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/use_taa : bool ; default=false

Enables temporal antialiasing for the default screen `Viewport`. TAA works by jittering the camera and accumulating the images of the last rendered frames, motion vector rendering is used to account for camera and object motion. Enabling TAA can make the image blurrier, which is partially counteracted by automatically using a negative mipmap LOD bias (see `rendering/textures/default_filters/texture_mipmap_bias`).
**Note:** The implementation is not complete yet. Some visual instances such as particles and skinned meshes may show ghosting artifacts in motion.
**Note:** TAA is only supported in the Forward+ rendering method, not Mobile or Compatibility.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To set TAA at runtime, set `Viewport.use_taa` on the root `Viewport` instead, or use `RenderingServer.viewport_set_use_taa`.

> property rendering/anti_aliasing/screen_space_roughness_limiter/amount : float ; default=0.25

**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To control the screen-space roughness limiter at runtime, call `RenderingServer.screen_space_roughness_limiter_set_active` instead.

> property rendering/anti_aliasing/screen_space_roughness_limiter/enabled : bool ; default=true

If `true`, enables a spatial filter to limit roughness in areas with high-frequency detail. This can help reduce specular aliasing to an extent, though not as much as enabling `rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/use_taa`. This filter has a small performance cost, so consider disabling it if it doesn't benefit your scene noticeably.
**Note:** The screen-space roughness limiter is only supported in the Forward+ and Mobile rendering methods, not Compatibility.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To control the screen-space roughness limiter at runtime, call `RenderingServer.screen_space_roughness_limiter_set_active` instead.

> property rendering/anti_aliasing/screen_space_roughness_limiter/limit : float ; default=0.18

**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To control the screen-space roughness limiter at runtime, call `RenderingServer.screen_space_roughness_limiter_set_active` instead.

> property rendering/camera/depth_of_field/depth_of_field_bokeh_quality : int ; default=1

Sets the quality of the depth of field effect. Higher quality takes more samples, which is slower but looks smoother.

> property rendering/camera/depth_of_field/depth_of_field_bokeh_shape : int ; default=1

Sets the depth of field shape. Can be Box, Hexagon, or Circle. Box is the fastest. Circle is the most realistic, but also the most expensive to compute.

> property rendering/camera/depth_of_field/depth_of_field_use_jitter : bool ; default=false

If `true`, jitters DOF samples to make effect slightly blurrier and hide lines created from low sample rates. This can result in a slightly grainy appearance when used with a low number of samples.

> property rendering/driver/depth_prepass/disable_for_vendors : String ; default="PowerVR,Mali,Adreno,Apple"

Disables `rendering/driver/depth_prepass/enable` conditionally for certain vendors. By default, disables the depth prepass for mobile devices as mobile devices do not benefit from the depth prepass due to their unique architecture.

> property rendering/driver/depth_prepass/enable : bool ; default=true

If `true`, performs a previous depth pass before rendering 3D materials. This increases performance significantly in scenes with high overdraw, when complex materials and lighting are used. However, in scenes with few occluded surfaces, the depth prepass may reduce performance. If your game is viewed from a fixed angle that makes it easy to avoid overdraw (such as top-down or side-scrolling perspective), consider disabling the depth prepass to improve performance. This setting can be changed at run-time to optimize performance depending on the scene currently being viewed.
**Note:** Depth prepass is only supported when using the Forward+ or Compatibility rendering method. When using the Mobile rendering method, there is no depth prepass performed.

> property rendering/driver/threads/thread_model : int ; default=1 ; experimental=This setting has several known bugs which can lead to crashing, especially when using particles or resizing the window. Not recommended for use in production at this stage.

The thread model to use for rendering. Rendering on a thread may improve performance, but synchronizing to the main thread can cause a bit more jitter.

> property rendering/environment/defaults/default_clear_color : Color ; default=Color(0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 1)

Default background clear color. Overridable per `Viewport` using its `Environment`. See `Environment.background_mode` and `Environment.background_color` in particular. To change this default color programmatically, use `RenderingServer.set_default_clear_color`.

> property rendering/environment/defaults/default_environment : String ; default=""

`Environment` that will be used as a fallback environment in case a scene does not specify its own environment. The default environment is loaded in at scene load time regardless of whether you have set an environment or not. If you do not rely on the fallback environment, you do not need to set this property.

> property rendering/environment/fog/use_legacy_blending : bool ; default=false

Enables legacy fog blending behavior from version 4.5 and earlier. This is intended for users who are developing on pre-4.6 versions and want to upgrade to 4.6 with the smallest possible change to their visuals.

> property rendering/environment/glow/upscale_mode : int ; default=1

Sets how the glow effect is upscaled before being copied onto the screen. Linear is faster, but looks blocky. Bicubic is slower but looks smooth.
**Note:** `rendering/environment/glow/upscale_mode` is only effective when using the Forward+ or Mobile rendering methods, as Compatibility uses a different glow implementation.

> property rendering/environment/glow/upscale_mode.mobile : int ; default=0

Lower-end override for `rendering/environment/glow/upscale_mode` on mobile devices, due to performance concerns or driver support.

> property rendering/environment/screen_space_reflection/half_size : bool ; default=true

If `true`, screen-space reflections will be rendered at half size and then upscaled before being added to the scene. This is faster but may look pixelated or cause flickering. If `false`, screen-space reflections will be rendered at full size.

> property rendering/environment/ssao/adaptive_target : float ; default=0.5

Quality target to use when `rendering/environment/ssao/quality` is set to `Ultra`. A value of `0.0` provides a quality and speed similar to `Medium` while a value of `1.0` provides much higher quality than any of the other settings at the cost of performance.

> property rendering/environment/ssao/blur_passes : int ; default=2

Number of blur passes to use when computing screen-space ambient occlusion. A higher number will result in a smoother look, but will be slower to compute and will have less high-frequency detail.

> property rendering/environment/ssao/fadeout_from : float ; default=50.0

Distance at which the screen-space ambient occlusion effect starts to fade out. Use this hide ambient occlusion from far away.

> property rendering/environment/ssao/fadeout_to : float ; default=300.0

Distance at which the screen-space ambient occlusion is fully faded out. Use this hide ambient occlusion from far away.

> property rendering/environment/ssao/half_size : bool ; default=true

If `true`, screen-space ambient occlusion will be rendered at half size and then upscaled before being added to the scene. This is significantly faster but may miss small details. If `false`, screen-space ambient occlusion will be rendered at full size.

> property rendering/environment/ssao/quality : int ; default=2

Sets the quality of the screen-space ambient occlusion effect. Higher values take more samples and so will result in better quality, at the cost of performance. Setting to `Ultra` will use the `rendering/environment/ssao/adaptive_target` setting.

> property rendering/environment/ssil/adaptive_target : float ; default=0.5

Quality target to use when `rendering/environment/ssil/quality` is set to `Ultra`. A value of `0.0` provides a quality and speed similar to `Medium` while a value of `1.0` provides much higher quality than any of the other settings at the cost of performance. When using the adaptive target, the performance cost scales with the complexity of the scene.

> property rendering/environment/ssil/blur_passes : int ; default=4

Number of blur passes to use when computing screen-space indirect lighting. A higher number will result in a smoother look, but will be slower to compute and will have less high-frequency detail.

> property rendering/environment/ssil/fadeout_from : float ; default=50.0

Distance at which the screen-space indirect lighting effect starts to fade out. Use this to hide screen-space indirect lighting from far away.

> property rendering/environment/ssil/fadeout_to : float ; default=300.0

Distance at which the screen-space indirect lighting is fully faded out. Use this to hide screen-space indirect lighting from far away.

> property rendering/environment/ssil/half_size : bool ; default=true

If `true`, screen-space indirect lighting will be rendered at half size and then upscaled before being added to the scene. This is significantly faster but may miss small details and may result in some objects appearing to glow at their edges.

> property rendering/environment/ssil/quality : int ; default=2

Sets the quality of the screen-space indirect lighting effect. Higher values take more samples and so will result in better quality, at the cost of performance. Setting to `Ultra` will use the `rendering/environment/ssil/adaptive_target` setting.

> property rendering/environment/subsurface_scattering/subsurface_scattering_depth_scale : float ; default=0.01

Scales the depth over which the subsurface scattering effect is applied. A high value may allow light to scatter into a part of the mesh or another mesh that is close in screen space but far in depth. See also `rendering/environment/subsurface_scattering/subsurface_scattering_scale`.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To set the subsurface scattering depth scale at runtime, call `RenderingServer.sub_surface_scattering_set_scale` instead.

> property rendering/environment/subsurface_scattering/subsurface_scattering_quality : int ; default=1

Sets the quality of the subsurface scattering effect. Higher values are slower but look nicer. This affects the rendering of materials that have `BaseMaterial3D.subsurf_scatter_enabled` set to `true`, along with `ShaderMaterial`s that set `SSS_STRENGTH`.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To set the subsurface scattering quality at runtime, call `RenderingServer.sub_surface_scattering_set_quality` instead.

> property rendering/environment/subsurface_scattering/subsurface_scattering_scale : float ; default=0.05

Scales the distance over which samples are taken for subsurface scattering effect. Changing this does not impact performance, but higher values will result in significant artifacts as the samples will become obviously spread out. A lower value results in a smaller spread of scattered light. See also `rendering/environment/subsurface_scattering/subsurface_scattering_depth_scale`.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To set the subsurface scattering scale at runtime, call `RenderingServer.sub_surface_scattering_set_scale` instead.

> property rendering/environment/volumetric_fog/use_filter : int ; default=1

Enables filtering of the volumetric fog effect prior to integration. This substantially blurs the fog which reduces fine details but also smooths out harsh edges and aliasing artifacts. Disable when more detail is required.

> property rendering/environment/volumetric_fog/volume_depth : int ; default=64

Number of slices to use along the depth of the froxel buffer for volumetric fog. A lower number will be more efficient but may result in artifacts appearing during camera movement. See also `Environment.volumetric_fog_length`.

> property rendering/environment/volumetric_fog/volume_size : int ; default=64

Base size used to determine size of froxel buffer in the camera X-axis and Y-axis. The final size is scaled by the aspect ratio of the screen, so actual values may differ from what is set. Set a larger size for more detailed fog, set a smaller size for better performance.

> property rendering/gl_compatibility/driver : String ; default="opengl3"

Sets the driver to be used by the renderer when using the Compatibility renderer. Editing this property has no effect in the default configuration, as first-party platforms each have platform-specific overrides. Use those overrides to configure the driver for each platform.
This can be overridden using the `--rendering-driver <driver>` command line argument.
Supported values are:
- `opengl3`, OpenGL 3.3 on desktop platforms, OpenGL ES 3.0 on mobile platforms, WebGL 2.0 on web.
- `opengl3_angle`, OpenGL ES 3.0 using the ANGLE compatibility layer, supported on macOS (over native OpenGL) and Windows (over Direct3D 11).
- `opengl3_es`, OpenGL ES 3.0 on Linux/BSD.
**Note:** The availability of these options depends on whether the engine was compiled with support for them (determined by SCons options `opengl3` and `angle_libs`).
**Note:** The actual rendering driver may be automatically changed by the engine as a result of a fallback, or a user-specified command line argument. To get the actual rendering driver that is used at runtime, use `RenderingServer.get_current_rendering_driver_name` instead of reading this project setting's value.

> property rendering/gl_compatibility/driver.android : String ; default="opengl3"

Android override for `rendering/gl_compatibility/driver`.
Only one option is supported:
- `opengl3`, OpenGL ES 3.0 from native drivers.

> property rendering/gl_compatibility/driver.ios : String ; default="opengl3"

iOS override for `rendering/gl_compatibility/driver`.
Only one option is supported:
- `opengl3`, OpenGL ES 3.0 from native drivers.

> property rendering/gl_compatibility/driver.linuxbsd : String ; default="opengl3"

LinuxBSD override for `rendering/gl_compatibility/driver`.
Two options are supported:
- `opengl3` (default), OpenGL 3.3 from native drivers.
- `opengl3_es`, OpenGL ES 3.0 from native drivers. If `rendering/gl_compatibility/fallback_to_gles` is enabled, this is used as a fallback if OpenGL 3.3 is not supported.

> property rendering/gl_compatibility/driver.macos : String ; default="opengl3"

macOS override for `rendering/gl_compatibility/driver`.
Two options are supported:
- `opengl3` (default), OpenGL 3.3 from native drivers. If `rendering/gl_compatibility/fallback_to_native` is enabled, this is used as a fallback if ANGLE is configured as the preferred driver but not supported.
- `opengl3_angle`, OpenGL ES 3.0 using the ANGLE compatibility layer over native OpenGL drivers. If `rendering/gl_compatibility/fallback_to_angle` is enabled, this is used as a fallback if OpenGL 3.3 is not supported.

> property rendering/gl_compatibility/driver.web : String ; default="opengl3"

Web override for `rendering/gl_compatibility/driver`.
Only one option is supported:
- `opengl3`, WebGL 2.0. The underlying native API depends on the target OS, browser, and browser configuration.

> property rendering/gl_compatibility/driver.windows : String ; default="opengl3"

Windows override for `rendering/gl_compatibility/driver`.
Two options are supported:
- `opengl3` (default), OpenGL 3.3 from native drivers. If `rendering/gl_compatibility/fallback_to_native` is enabled, this is used as a fallback if ANGLE is configured as the preferred driver but not supported.
- `opengl3_angle`, OpenGL ES 3.0 using the ANGLE compatibility layer over native Direct3D 11 drivers. If `rendering/gl_compatibility/fallback_to_angle` is enabled, this is used as a fallback if OpenGL 3.3 is not supported. By default, ANGLE is used as the default driver for some devices listed in `rendering/gl_compatibility/force_angle_on_devices`.

> property rendering/gl_compatibility/fallback_to_angle : bool ; default=true

If `true`, the Compatibility renderer will fall back to ANGLE if native OpenGL is not supported or the device is listed in `rendering/gl_compatibility/force_angle_on_devices`.
**Note:** This setting is implemented only on Windows.

> property rendering/gl_compatibility/fallback_to_gles : bool ; default=true

If `true`, the Compatibility renderer will fall back to OpenGLES if desktop OpenGL is not supported.
**Note:** This setting is implemented only on Linux/X11.

> property rendering/gl_compatibility/fallback_to_native : bool ; default=true

If `true`, the Compatibility renderer will fall back to native OpenGL if ANGLE is not supported, or ANGLE dynamic libraries aren't found.
**Note:** This setting is implemented on macOS and Windows.

> property rendering/gl_compatibility/force_angle_on_devices : Array

An `Array` of devices which should always use the ANGLE renderer.
Each entry is a `Dictionary` with the following keys: `vendor` and `name`. `name` can be set to `*` to add all devices with the specified `vendor`.
**Note:** This setting is implemented only on Windows.

> property rendering/gl_compatibility/item_buffer_size : int ; default=16384

Maximum number of canvas items commands that can be drawn in a single viewport update. If more render commands are issued they will be ignored. Decreasing this limit may improve performance on bandwidth limited devices. Increase this limit if you find that not all objects are being drawn in a frame.

> property rendering/gl_compatibility/nvidia_disable_threaded_optimization : bool ; default=true

If `true`, disables the threaded optimization feature from the NVIDIA drivers, which are known to cause stuttering in most OpenGL applications.
**Note:** This setting only works on Windows, as threaded optimization is disabled by default on other platforms.

> property rendering/global_illumination/gi/use_half_resolution : bool ; default=false

If `true`, renders `VoxelGI` and SDFGI (`Environment.sdfgi_enabled`) buffers at halved resolution (e.g. 960×540 when the viewport size is 1920×1080). This improves performance significantly when VoxelGI or SDFGI is enabled, at the cost of artifacts that may be visible on polygon edges. The loss in quality becomes less noticeable as the viewport resolution increases. `LightmapGI` rendering is not affected by this setting.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To set half-resolution GI at run-time, call `RenderingServer.gi_set_use_half_resolution` instead.

> property rendering/global_illumination/sdfgi/frames_to_converge : int ; default=5

The number of frames to use for converging signed distance field global illumination. Higher values lead to a less noisy result, at the cost of taking a longer time to fully converge. This means the scene's global illumination will be too dark for a longer period of time, especially when the camera moves fast. The actual convergence speed depends on rendered framerate. For example, with the default setting of 30 frames, rendering at 60 FPS will make SDFGI fully converge after 0.5 seconds. See also `rendering/global_illumination/sdfgi/frames_to_update_lights` and `rendering/global_illumination/sdfgi/probe_ray_count`.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To control SDFGI convergence speed at runtime, call `RenderingServer.environment_set_sdfgi_frames_to_converge` instead.

> property rendering/global_illumination/sdfgi/frames_to_update_lights : int ; default=2

The number of frames over which dynamic lights should be updated in signed distance field global illumination. Higher values take more time to update indirect lighting coming from dynamic lights, but result in better performance when many dynamic lights are present. See also `rendering/global_illumination/sdfgi/frames_to_converge` and `rendering/global_illumination/sdfgi/probe_ray_count`.
**Note:** This only affects `Light3D` nodes whose `Light3D.light_bake_mode` is `Light3D.BAKE_DYNAMIC` (which is the default). Consider making non-moving lights use the `Light3D.BAKE_STATIC` bake mode to improve performance.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To control SDFGI light update speed at runtime, call `RenderingServer.environment_set_sdfgi_frames_to_update_light` instead.

> property rendering/global_illumination/sdfgi/probe_ray_count : int ; default=1

The number of rays to throw per frame when computing signed distance field global illumination. Higher values lead to a less noisy result, at the cost of performance. See also `rendering/global_illumination/sdfgi/frames_to_converge` and `rendering/global_illumination/sdfgi/frames_to_update_lights`.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To control SDFGI quality at runtime, call `RenderingServer.environment_set_sdfgi_ray_count` instead.

> property rendering/global_illumination/voxel_gi/quality : int ; default=0

The VoxelGI quality to use. High quality leads to more precise lighting and better reflections, but is slower to render. This setting does not affect the baked data and doesn't require baking the `VoxelGI` again to apply.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To control VoxelGI quality at runtime, call `RenderingServer.voxel_gi_set_quality` instead.

> property rendering/lightmapping/bake_performance/max_rays_per_pass : int ; default=4

The maximum number of rays that can be thrown per pass when baking lightmaps with `LightmapGI`. Depending on the scene, adjusting this value may result in higher GPU utilization when baking lightmaps, leading to faster bake times.
**Note:** Using a value that is too high for your system can cause crashes due to the GPU being unresponsive for long periods of time, and the graphics driver being reset by the OS.

> property rendering/lightmapping/bake_performance/max_rays_per_probe_pass : int ; default=64

The maximum number of rays that can be thrown per pass when baking dynamic object lighting in `LightmapProbe`s with `LightmapGI`. Depending on the scene, adjusting this value may result in higher GPU utilization when baking lightmaps, leading to faster bake times.
**Note:** Using a value that is too high for your system can cause crashes due to the GPU being unresponsive for long periods of time, and the graphics driver being reset by the OS.

> property rendering/lightmapping/bake_performance/max_transparency_rays : int ; default=8

The maximum number of retry rays that can be thrown per pass when hitting a transparent surface when baking lightmaps with `LightmapGI`. Depending on the scene, reducing this value may lead to faster bake times.
**Note:** Using a value that is too high for your system can cause crashes due to the GPU being unresponsive for long periods of time, and the graphics driver being reset by the OS.

> property rendering/lightmapping/bake_performance/region_size : int ; default=512

The region size to use when baking lightmaps with `LightmapGI`. The specified value is rounded up to the nearest power of 2.
**Note:** Using a value that is too high for your system can cause crashes due to the GPU being unresponsive for long periods of time, and the graphics driver being reset by the OS.

> property rendering/lightmapping/bake_quality/high_quality_probe_ray_count : int ; default=512

The number of rays to use for baking dynamic object lighting in `LightmapProbe`s when `LightmapGI.quality` is `LightmapGI.BAKE_QUALITY_HIGH`.

> property rendering/lightmapping/bake_quality/high_quality_ray_count : int ; default=512

The number of rays to use for baking lightmaps with `LightmapGI` when `LightmapGI.quality` is `LightmapGI.BAKE_QUALITY_HIGH`.

> property rendering/lightmapping/bake_quality/low_quality_probe_ray_count : int ; default=64

The number of rays to use for baking dynamic object lighting in `LightmapProbe`s when `LightmapGI.quality` is `LightmapGI.BAKE_QUALITY_LOW`.

> property rendering/lightmapping/bake_quality/low_quality_ray_count : int ; default=32

The number of rays to use for baking lightmaps with `LightmapGI` when `LightmapGI.quality` is `LightmapGI.BAKE_QUALITY_LOW`.

> property rendering/lightmapping/bake_quality/medium_quality_probe_ray_count : int ; default=256

The number of rays to use for baking dynamic object lighting in `LightmapProbe`s when `LightmapGI.quality` is `LightmapGI.BAKE_QUALITY_MEDIUM`.

> property rendering/lightmapping/bake_quality/medium_quality_ray_count : int ; default=128

The number of rays to use for baking lightmaps with `LightmapGI` when `LightmapGI.quality` is `LightmapGI.BAKE_QUALITY_MEDIUM`.

> property rendering/lightmapping/bake_quality/ultra_quality_probe_ray_count : int ; default=2048

The number of rays to use for baking dynamic object lighting in `LightmapProbe`s when `LightmapGI.quality` is `LightmapGI.BAKE_QUALITY_ULTRA`.

> property rendering/lightmapping/bake_quality/ultra_quality_ray_count : int ; default=2048

The number of rays to use for baking lightmaps with `LightmapGI` when `LightmapGI.quality` is `LightmapGI.BAKE_QUALITY_ULTRA`.

> property rendering/lightmapping/denoising/denoiser : int ; default=0

Denoiser tool used for denoising lightmaps.
Using [OpenImageDenoise](https://www.openimagedenoise.org/) (OIDN) requires configuring a path to an OIDN executable in the editor settings at `EditorSettings.filesystem/tools/oidn/oidn_denoise_path`. OIDN can be downloaded from [OpenImageDenoise's downloads page](https://www.openimagedenoise.org/downloads.html).
OIDN will use GPU acceleration when available. Unlike JNLM which uses compute shaders for acceleration, OIDN uses vendor-specific acceleration methods. For GPU acceleration to be available, the following libraries must be installed on the system depending on your GPU:
- NVIDIA GPUs: CUDA libraries
- AMD GPUs: HIP libraries
- Intel GPUs: SYCL libraries
If no GPU acceleration is configured on the system, multi-threaded CPU-based denoising will be performed instead. This CPU-based denoising is significantly slower than the JNLM denoiser in most cases.

> property rendering/lightmapping/lightmap_gi/use_bicubic_filter : bool ; default=true

If `true`, applies a bicubic filter during lightmap sampling. This makes lightmaps look much smoother, at a moderate performance cost.
**Note:** The bicubic filter exaggerates the 'bleeding' effect that occurs when a lightmap's resolution is low enough.

> property rendering/lightmapping/primitive_meshes/texel_size : float ; default=0.2

The texel_size that is used to calculate the `Mesh.lightmap_size_hint` on `PrimitiveMesh` resources if `PrimitiveMesh.add_uv2` is enabled.

> property rendering/lightmapping/probe_capture/update_speed : float ; default=15

The framerate-independent update speed when representing dynamic object lighting from `LightmapProbe`s. Higher values make dynamic object lighting update faster. Higher values can prevent fast-moving objects from having "outdated" indirect lighting displayed on them, at the cost of possible flickering when an object moves from a bright area to a shaded area.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To adjust the BVH build quality at runtime, use `RenderingServer.lightmap_set_probe_capture_update_speed`.

> property rendering/lights_and_shadows/directional_shadow/16_bits : bool ; default=true

Use 16 bits for the directional shadow depth map. Enabling this results in shadows having less precision and may result in shadow acne, but can lead to performance improvements on some devices.

> property rendering/lights_and_shadows/directional_shadow/size : int ; default=4096

The directional shadow's size in pixels. Higher values will result in sharper shadows, at the cost of performance. The value is rounded up to the nearest power of 2.

> property rendering/lights_and_shadows/directional_shadow/size.mobile : int ; default=2048

Lower-end override for `rendering/lights_and_shadows/directional_shadow/size` on mobile devices, due to performance concerns or driver support.

> property rendering/lights_and_shadows/directional_shadow/soft_shadow_filter_quality : int ; default=2

Quality setting for shadows cast by `DirectionalLight3D`s. Higher quality settings use more samples when reading from shadow maps and are thus slower. Low quality settings may result in shadows looking grainy.
**Note:** The Soft Very Low setting will automatically multiply *constant* shadow blur by 0.75x to reduce the amount of noise visible. This automatic blur change only affects the constant blur factor defined in `Light3D.shadow_blur`, not the variable blur performed by `DirectionalLight3D`s' `Light3D.light_angular_distance`.
**Note:** The Soft High and Soft Ultra settings will automatically multiply *constant* shadow blur by 1.5× and 2× respectively to make better use of the increased sample count. This increased blur also improves stability of dynamic object shadows.

> property rendering/lights_and_shadows/directional_shadow/soft_shadow_filter_quality.mobile : int ; default=0

Lower-end override for `rendering/lights_and_shadows/directional_shadow/soft_shadow_filter_quality` on mobile devices, due to performance concerns or driver support.

> property rendering/lights_and_shadows/positional_shadow/atlas_16_bits : bool ; default=true

Use 16 bits for the omni/spot shadow depth map. Enabling this results in shadows having less precision and may result in shadow acne, but can lead to performance improvements on some devices.

> property rendering/lights_and_shadows/positional_shadow/atlas_quadrant_0_subdiv : int ; default=2

The subdivision amount of the first quadrant on the shadow atlas. See the [documentation]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/3d/lights_and_shadows.html#shadow-atlas) for more information.

> property rendering/lights_and_shadows/positional_shadow/atlas_quadrant_1_subdiv : int ; default=2

The subdivision amount of the second quadrant on the shadow atlas. See the [documentation]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/3d/lights_and_shadows.html#shadow-atlas) for more information.

> property rendering/lights_and_shadows/positional_shadow/atlas_quadrant_2_subdiv : int ; default=3

The subdivision amount of the third quadrant on the shadow atlas. See the [documentation]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/3d/lights_and_shadows.html#shadow-atlas) for more information.

> property rendering/lights_and_shadows/positional_shadow/atlas_quadrant_3_subdiv : int ; default=4

The subdivision amount of the fourth quadrant on the shadow atlas. See the [documentation]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/3d/lights_and_shadows.html#shadow-atlas) for more information.

> property rendering/lights_and_shadows/positional_shadow/atlas_size : int ; default=4096

The size of the shadow atlas used for `OmniLight3D` and `SpotLight3D` nodes. See the [documentation]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/3d/lights_and_shadows.html#shadow-atlas) for more information.

> property rendering/lights_and_shadows/positional_shadow/atlas_size.mobile : int ; default=2048

Lower-end override for `rendering/lights_and_shadows/positional_shadow/atlas_size` on mobile devices, due to performance concerns or driver support.

> property rendering/lights_and_shadows/positional_shadow/soft_shadow_filter_quality : int ; default=2

Quality setting for shadows cast by `OmniLight3D`s and `SpotLight3D`s. Higher quality settings use more samples when reading from shadow maps and are thus slower. Low quality settings may result in shadows looking grainy.
**Note:** The Soft Very Low setting will automatically multiply *constant* shadow blur by 0.75x to reduce the amount of noise visible. This automatic blur change only affects the constant blur factor defined in `Light3D.shadow_blur`, not the variable blur performed by `DirectionalLight3D`s' `Light3D.light_angular_distance`.
**Note:** The Soft High and Soft Ultra settings will automatically multiply shadow blur by 1.5× and 2× respectively to make better use of the increased sample count. This increased blur also improves stability of dynamic object shadows.

> property rendering/lights_and_shadows/positional_shadow/soft_shadow_filter_quality.mobile : int ; default=0

Lower-end override for `rendering/lights_and_shadows/positional_shadow/soft_shadow_filter_quality` on mobile devices, due to performance concerns or driver support.

> property rendering/lights_and_shadows/tighter_shadow_caster_culling : bool ; default=true

If `true`, items that cannot cast shadows into the view frustum will not be rendered into shadow maps.
This can increase performance.

> property rendering/lights_and_shadows/use_physical_light_units : bool ; default=false

Enables the use of physically based units for light sources. Physically based units tend to be much larger than the arbitrary units used by Godot, but they can be used to match lighting within Godot to real-world lighting. Due to the large dynamic range of lighting conditions present in nature, Godot bakes exposure into the various lighting quantities before rendering. Most light sources bake exposure automatically at run time based on the active `CameraAttributes` resource, but `LightmapGI` and `VoxelGI` require a `CameraAttributes` resource to be set at bake time to reduce the dynamic range. At run time, Godot will automatically reconcile the baked exposure with the active exposure to ensure lighting remains consistent.

> property rendering/limits/cluster_builder/max_clustered_elements : float ; default=512

The maximum number of clustered elements (`OmniLight3D` + `SpotLight3D` + `Decal` + `ReflectionProbe`) that can be rendered at once in the camera view. If there are more clustered elements present in the camera view, some of them will not be rendered (leading to pop-in during camera movement). Enabling distance fade on lights and decals (`Light3D.distance_fade_enabled`, `Decal.distance_fade_enabled`) can help avoid reaching this limit.
Decreasing this value may improve GPU performance on certain setups, even if the maximum number of clustered elements is never reached in the project.
**Note:** This setting is only effective when using the Forward+ rendering method, not Mobile and Compatibility.

> property rendering/limits/global_shader_variables/buffer_size : int ; default=65536

The maximum number of uniforms that can be used by the global shader uniform buffer. Each item takes up one slot. In other words, a single uniform float and a uniform vec4 will take the same amount of space in the buffer.
**Note:** When using the Compatibility renderer, most mobile devices (and all web exports) will be limited to a maximum size of 1024 due to hardware constraints.

> property rendering/limits/opengl/max_lights_per_object : int ; default=8

Max number of omnilights and spotlights renderable per object. At the default value of 8, this means that each surface can be affected by up to 8 omnilights and 8 spotlights. This is further limited by hardware support and `rendering/limits/opengl/max_renderable_lights`. Setting this low will slightly reduce memory usage, may decrease shader compile times, and may result in faster rendering on low-end, mobile, or web devices.
**Note:** This setting is only effective when using the Compatibility rendering method, not Forward+ and Mobile.

> property rendering/limits/opengl/max_renderable_elements : int ; default=65536

Max number of elements renderable in a frame. If more elements than this are visible per frame, they will not be drawn. Keep in mind elements refer to mesh surfaces and not meshes themselves. Setting this low will slightly reduce memory usage and may decrease shader compile times, particularly on web. For most uses, the default value is suitable, but consider lowering as much as possible on web export.
**Note:** This setting is only effective when using the Compatibility rendering method, not Forward+ and Mobile.

> property rendering/limits/opengl/max_renderable_lights : int ; default=32

Max number of positional lights renderable in a frame. If more lights than this number are used, they will be ignored. Setting this low will slightly reduce memory usage and may decrease shader compile times, particularly on web. For most uses, the default value is suitable, but consider lowering as much as possible on web export.
**Note:** This setting is only effective when using the Compatibility rendering method, not Forward+ and Mobile.

> property rendering/limits/spatial_indexer/threaded_cull_minimum_instances : int ; default=1000

The minimum number of instances that must be present in a scene to enable culling computations on multiple threads. If a scene has fewer instances than this number, culling is done on a single thread.

> property rendering/limits/spatial_indexer/update_iterations_per_frame : int ; default=10

> property rendering/limits/time/time_rollover_secs : float ; default=3600

Maximum time (in seconds) before the `TIME` shader built-in variable rolls over. The `TIME` variable increments by `delta` each frame, and when it exceeds this value, it rolls over to `0.0`. Since large floating-point values are less precise than small floating-point values, this should be set as low as possible to maximize the precision of the `TIME` built-in variable in shaders. This is especially important on mobile platforms where precision in shaders is significantly reduced. However, if this is set too low, shader animations may appear to restart from the beginning while the project is running.
On desktop platforms, values below `4096` are recommended, ideally below `2048`. On mobile platforms, values below `64` are recommended, ideally below `32`.

> property rendering/mesh_lod/lod_change/threshold_pixels : float ; default=1.0

The automatic LOD bias to use for meshes rendered within the `ReflectionProbe`. Higher values will use less detailed versions of meshes that have LOD variations generated. If set to `0.0`, automatic LOD is disabled. Increase `rendering/mesh_lod/lod_change/threshold_pixels` to improve performance at the cost of geometry detail.
**Note:** Depending on the mesh's attributes (vertex colors, blend shapes, ...), a mesh may have fewer levels of LOD generated to avoid visible distortion of the mesh once it is affected by vertex colors or blend shapes. Meshes with a very low vertex count will also not have any LODs generated, which means this setting will not affect them at all. In general, this setting makes the largest impact on static meshes with a high vertex count.
**Note:** `rendering/mesh_lod/lod_change/threshold_pixels` does not affect `GeometryInstance3D` visibility ranges (also known as "manual" LOD or hierarchical LOD).
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To adjust the automatic LOD threshold at runtime, set `Viewport.mesh_lod_threshold` on the root `Viewport`.

> property rendering/occlusion_culling/bvh_build_quality : int ; default=2

The [Bounding Volume Hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounding_volume_hierarchy) quality to use when rendering the occlusion culling buffer. Higher values will result in more accurate occlusion culling, at the cost of higher CPU usage. See also `rendering/occlusion_culling/occlusion_rays_per_thread`.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To adjust the BVH build quality at runtime, use `RenderingServer.viewport_set_occlusion_culling_build_quality`.

> property rendering/occlusion_culling/jitter_projection : bool ; default=true

If `true`, the projection used for rendering the occlusion buffer will be jittered. This can help prevent objects being incorrectly culled when visible through small gaps.

> property rendering/occlusion_culling/occlusion_rays_per_thread : int ; default=512

The number of occlusion rays traced per CPU thread. Higher values will result in more accurate occlusion culling, at the cost of higher CPU usage. The occlusion culling buffer's pixel count is roughly equal to `occlusion_rays_per_thread * number_of_logical_cpu_cores`, so it will depend on the system's CPU. Therefore, CPUs with fewer cores will use a lower resolution to attempt keeping performance costs even across devices. See also `rendering/occlusion_culling/bvh_build_quality`.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To adjust the number of occlusion rays traced per thread at runtime, use `RenderingServer.viewport_set_occlusion_rays_per_thread`.

> property rendering/occlusion_culling/use_occlusion_culling : bool ; default=false

If `true`, `OccluderInstance3D` nodes will be usable for occlusion culling in 3D in the root viewport. In custom viewports, `Viewport.use_occlusion_culling` must be set to `true` instead.
**Note:** Enabling occlusion culling has a cost on the CPU. Only enable occlusion culling if you actually plan to use it. Large open scenes with few or no objects blocking the view will generally not benefit much from occlusion culling. Large open scenes generally benefit more from mesh LOD and visibility ranges (`GeometryInstance3D.visibility_range_begin` and `GeometryInstance3D.visibility_range_end`) compared to occlusion culling.
**Note:** Due to memory constraints, occlusion culling is not supported by default in Web export templates. It can be enabled by compiling custom Web export templates with `module_raycast_enabled=yes`.

> property rendering/reflections/reflection_atlas/reflection_count : int ; default=64

Number of cubemaps to store in the reflection atlas. The number of `ReflectionProbe`s in a scene will be limited by this amount. A higher number requires more VRAM.

> property rendering/reflections/reflection_atlas/reflection_size : int ; default=256

Size of cubemap faces for `ReflectionProbe`s. A higher number requires more VRAM and may make reflection probe updating slower.

> property rendering/reflections/reflection_atlas/reflection_size.mobile : int ; default=128

Lower-end override for `rendering/reflections/reflection_atlas/reflection_size` on mobile devices, due to performance concerns or driver support.

> property rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/fast_filter_high_quality : bool ; default=false

Use a higher quality variant of the fast filtering algorithm. Significantly slower than using default quality, but results in smoother reflections. Should only be used when the scene is especially detailed.

> property rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/ggx_samples : int ; default=32

Sets the number of samples to take when using importance sampling for `Sky`s and `ReflectionProbe`s. A higher value will result in smoother, higher quality reflections, but increases time to calculate radiance maps. In general, fewer samples are needed for simpler, low dynamic range environments while more samples are needed for HDR environments and environments with a high level of detail.

> property rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/ggx_samples.mobile : int ; default=16

Lower-end override for `rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/ggx_samples` on mobile devices, due to performance concerns or driver support.

> property rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/roughness_layers : int ; default=8

Limits the number of layers to use in radiance maps when using importance sampling. A lower number will be slightly faster and take up less VRAM.

> property rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/texture_array_reflections : bool ; default=true

If `true`, uses texture arrays instead of mipmaps for reflection probes and panorama backgrounds (sky). This reduces jitter noise and upscaling artifacts on reflections, but is significantly slower to compute and uses `rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/roughness_layers` times more memory.
**Note:** Texture array reflections are always disabled on macOS on Intel GPUs due to driver bugs.

> property rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/texture_array_reflections.mobile : bool ; default=false

Lower-end override for `rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/texture_array_reflections` on mobile devices, due to performance concerns or driver support.

> property rendering/reflections/specular_occlusion/enabled : bool ; default=true

If `true`, reduces reflections based on ambient light.

> property rendering/renderer/rendering_method : String ; default="forward_plus"

Sets the renderer that will be used by the project. Options are:
**forward_plus** (Forward+): High-end renderer designed for desktop devices. Has a higher base overhead, but scales well with complex scenes. Not suitable for older devices or mobile.
**mobile** (Mobile): Modern renderer designed for mobile devices. Has a lower base overhead than Forward+, but does not scale as well to large scenes with many elements.
**gl_compatibility** (Compatibility): Low-end renderer designed for older devices. Based on the limitations of the OpenGL 3.3 / OpenGL ES 3.0 / WebGL 2 APIs. Lighting calculations are performed on nonlinear sRGB-encoded color data, which produces inaccurate results that may look acceptable for some games.
This can be overridden using the `--rendering-method <method>` command line argument.
**Note:** The actual rendering method may be automatically changed by the engine as a result of a fallback, or a user-specified command line argument. To get the actual rendering method that is used at runtime, use `RenderingServer.get_current_rendering_method` instead of reading this project setting's value.

> property rendering/renderer/rendering_method.mobile : String ; default="mobile"

Override for `rendering/renderer/rendering_method` on mobile devices.

> property rendering/renderer/rendering_method.web : String ; default="gl_compatibility"

Override for `rendering/renderer/rendering_method` on web.

> property rendering/rendering_device/d3d12/agility_sdk_version : int ; default=618

Version code of the [Direct3D 12 Agility SDK](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/directx12agility/) to use (`D3D12SDKVersion`). This must match the *minor* version that is installed next to the editor binary and in the export templates directory for the current editor version. For example, if you have `1.618.5` installed, you need to input `618` here.

> property rendering/rendering_device/d3d12/max_resource_descriptors : int ; default=65536

The number of entries in the resource descriptor heap the Direct3D 12 rendering driver uses for most rendering operations.
Depending on the complexity of scenes, this value may be lowered or may need to be raised.

> property rendering/rendering_device/d3d12/max_sampler_descriptors : int ; default=1024

The number of entries in the sampler descriptor heap the Direct3D 12 rendering driver uses for most rendering operations.
Depending on the complexity of scenes, this value may be lowered or may need to be raised.

> property rendering/rendering_device/driver : String ; default="vulkan"

Sets the driver to be used by the renderer when using a RenderingDevice-based renderer like the Forward+ or Mobile renderers. Editing this property has no effect in the default configuration, as first-party platforms each have platform-specific overrides. Use those overrides to configure the driver for each platform.
This can be overridden using the `--rendering-driver <driver>` command line argument.
Supported values are:
- `metal`, Metal (supported on Apple Silicon Macs and iOS).
- `vulkan`, Vulkan (supported on all desktop and mobile platforms).
- `d3d12`, Direct3D 12 (supported on Windows).
**Note:** The availability of these options depends on whether the engine was compiled with support for them (determined by SCons options `vulkan`, `metal`, and `d3d12`).
**Note:** If a given platform has no registered drivers, it can fall back to the Compatibility renderer (OpenGL 3) if `rendering/rendering_device/fallback_to_opengl3` is enabled. This fallback happens automatically for the Web platform regardless of that property.
**Note:** The actual rendering driver may be automatically changed by the engine as a result of a fallback, or a user-specified command line argument. To get the actual rendering driver that is used at runtime, use `RenderingServer.get_current_rendering_driver_name` instead of reading this project setting's value.

> property rendering/rendering_device/driver.android : String ; default="vulkan"

Android override for `rendering/rendering_device/driver`.
Only one option is supported:
- `vulkan`, Vulkan from native drivers.
**Note:** If Vulkan was disabled at compile time, there is no alternative RenderingDevice driver.

> property rendering/rendering_device/driver.ios : String ; default="metal"

iOS override for `rendering/rendering_device/driver`.
Two options are supported:
- `metal` (default), Metal from native drivers.
- `vulkan`, Vulkan over Metal via MoltenVK.

> property rendering/rendering_device/driver.linuxbsd : String ; default="vulkan"

LinuxBSD override for `rendering/rendering_device/driver`.
Only one option is supported:
- `vulkan`, Vulkan from native drivers.
**Note:** If Vulkan was disabled at compile time, there is no alternative RenderingDevice driver.

> property rendering/rendering_device/driver.macos : String ; default="metal"

macOS override for `rendering/rendering_device/driver`.
Two options are supported:
- `metal` (default), Metal from native drivers, only supported on Apple Silicon Macs. On Intel Macs, it will automatically fall back to `vulkan` as Metal support is not implemented.
- `vulkan`, Vulkan over Metal via MoltenVK, supported on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.

> property rendering/rendering_device/driver.visionos : String ; default="metal"

visionOS override for `rendering/rendering_device/driver`.
Only one option is supported:
- `metal` (default), Metal from native drivers.

> property rendering/rendering_device/driver.windows : String ; default="vulkan"

Windows override for `rendering/rendering_device/driver`.
Two options are supported:
- `vulkan` (default), Vulkan from native drivers. If `rendering/rendering_device/fallback_to_vulkan` is enabled, this is used as a fallback if Direct3D 12 is not supported.
- `d3d12`, Direct3D 12 from native drivers. If `rendering/rendering_device/fallback_to_d3d12` is enabled, this is used as a fallback if Vulkan is not supported.
**Note:** Starting with Godot 4.6, new projects are configured by default to use `d3d12` on Windows. Projects created before Godot 4.6 keep `vulkan` for compatibility reasons, but it is recommended to switch them manually to `d3d12`.

> property rendering/rendering_device/fallback_to_d3d12 : bool ; default=true

If `true`, the Forward+ renderer will fall back to Direct3D 12 if Vulkan is not supported. The fallback is always attempted regardless of this setting if Vulkan driver support was disabled at compile time.
**Note:** This setting is implemented only on Windows.

> property rendering/rendering_device/fallback_to_opengl3 : bool ; default=true

If `true`, the Forward+ renderer will fall back to OpenGL 3 if Direct3D 12, Metal, and Vulkan are not supported.
**Note:** This setting is implemented on Windows, Android, macOS, iOS, and Linux/X11.

> property rendering/rendering_device/fallback_to_vulkan : bool ; default=true

If `true`, the Forward+ renderer will fall back to Vulkan if Direct3D 12 (on Windows) or Metal (on macOS x86_64) are not supported. The fallback is always attempted regardless of this setting if Direct3D 12 (Windows) or Metal (macOS) driver support was disabled at compile time.
**Note:** This setting is implemented on Windows and macOS.

> property rendering/rendering_device/pipeline_cache/enable : bool ; default=true

Enable the pipeline cache that is saved to disk if the graphics API supports it.
**Note:** This property is unable to control the pipeline caching the GPU driver itself does. Only turn this off along with deleting the contents of the driver's cache if you wish to simulate the experience a user will get when starting the game for the first time.

> property rendering/rendering_device/pipeline_cache/save_chunk_size_mb : float ; default=3.0

Determines at which interval pipeline cache is saved to disk. The lower the value, the more often it is saved.

> property rendering/rendering_device/staging_buffer/block_size_kb : int ; default=256

The size of a block allocated in the staging buffers. Staging buffers are the intermediate resources the engine uses to upload or download data to the GPU. This setting determines the max amount of data that can be transferred in a copy operation. Increasing this will result in faster data transfers at the cost of extra memory.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. There is currently no way to change this value at run-time.

> property rendering/rendering_device/staging_buffer/max_size_mb : int ; default=128

The maximum amount of memory allowed to be used by staging buffers. If the amount of data being uploaded or downloaded exceeds this amount, the GPU will stall and wait for previous frames to finish.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. There is currently no way to change this value at run-time.

> property rendering/rendering_device/staging_buffer/texture_download_region_size_px : int ; default=64

The region size in pixels used to download texture data from the GPU when using methods like `RenderingDevice.texture_get_data_async`.
**Note:** This property's upper limit is controlled by `rendering/rendering_device/staging_buffer/block_size_kb` and whether it's possible to allocate a single block of texture data with this region size in the format that is requested.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. There is currently no way to change this value at run-time.

> property rendering/rendering_device/staging_buffer/texture_upload_region_size_px : int ; default=64

The region size in pixels used to upload texture data from the GPU when using methods like `RenderingDevice.texture_update`.
**Note:** This property's upper limit is controlled by `rendering/rendering_device/staging_buffer/block_size_kb` and whether it's possible to allocate a single block of texture data with this region size in the format that is requested.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. There is currently no way to change this value at run-time.

> property rendering/rendering_device/vsync/frame_queue_size : int ; default=2

The number of frames to track on the CPU side before stalling to wait for the GPU.
Try the [V-Sync Simulator](https://darksylinc.github.io/vsync_simulator/), an interactive interface that simulates presentation to better understand how it is affected by different variables under various conditions.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. There is currently no way to change this value at run-time.

> property rendering/rendering_device/vsync/swapchain_image_count : int ; default=3

The number of images the swapchain will consist of (back buffers + front buffer).
`2` corresponds to double-buffering and `3` to triple-buffering.
Double-buffering may give you the lowest lag/latency but if V-Sync is on and the system can't render at 60 fps, the framerate will go down in multiples of it (e.g. 30 fps, 15, 7.5, etc.). Triple buffering gives you higher framerate (specially if the system can't reach a constant 60 fps) at the cost of up to 1 frame of latency, with `DisplayServer.VSYNC_ENABLED` (FIFO).
Use double-buffering with `DisplayServer.VSYNC_ENABLED`. Triple-buffering is a must if you plan on using `DisplayServer.VSYNC_MAILBOX` mode.
Try the [V-Sync Simulator](https://darksylinc.github.io/vsync_simulator/), an interactive interface that simulates presentation to better understand how it is affected by different variables under various conditions.
**Note:** Changes to this setting will only be applied on startup or when the swapchain is recreated (e.g. when setting the V-Sync mode).
**Note:** Some platforms may restrict the actual value.

> property rendering/rendering_device/vulkan/max_descriptors_per_pool : int ; default=64

The number of descriptors per pool. Godot's Vulkan backend uses linear pools for descriptors that will be created and destroyed within a single frame. Instead of destroying every single descriptor every frame, they all can be destroyed at once by resetting the pool they belong to.
A larger number is more efficient up to a limit, after that it will only waste RAM (maximum efficiency is achieved when there is no more than 1 pool per frame). A small number could end up with one pool per descriptor, which negatively impacts performance.
**Note:** Changing this property requires a restart to take effect.

> property rendering/scaling_3d/fsr_sharpness : float ; default=0.2

Determines how sharp the upscaled image will be when using the FSR upscaling mode. Sharpness halves with every whole number. Values go from 0.0 (sharpest) to 2.0. Values above 2.0 won't make a visible difference.

> property rendering/scaling_3d/mode : int ; default=0

Sets the scaling 3D mode. Bilinear scaling renders at different resolution to either undersample or supersample the viewport. FidelityFX Super Resolution 1.0, abbreviated to FSR, is an upscaling technology that produces high quality images at fast framerates by using a spatially-aware upscaling algorithm. FSR is slightly more expensive than bilinear, but it produces significantly higher image quality. On particularly low-end GPUs, the added cost of FSR may not be worth it (compared to using bilinear scaling with a slightly higher resolution scale to match performance).
**Note:** FSR is only effective when using the Forward+ rendering method, not Mobile or Compatibility. If using an incompatible rendering method, FSR will fall back to bilinear scaling.

> property rendering/scaling_3d/mode.ios : int

iOS override for `rendering/scaling_3d/mode`. This allows selecting the MetalFX spatial and MetalFX temporal scaling modes, which are exclusive to platforms where the Metal rendering driver is used.

> property rendering/scaling_3d/mode.macos : int

macOS override for `rendering/scaling_3d/mode`. This allows selecting the MetalFX spatial and MetalFX temporal scaling modes, which are exclusive to platforms where the Metal rendering driver is used.

> property rendering/scaling_3d/scale : float ; default=1.0

Scales the 3D render buffer based on the viewport size uses an image filter specified in `rendering/scaling_3d/mode` to scale the output image to the full viewport size. Values lower than `1.0` can be used to speed up 3D rendering at the cost of quality (undersampling). Values greater than `1.0` are only valid for bilinear mode and can be used to improve 3D rendering quality at a high performance cost (supersampling). See also `rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/msaa_3d` for multi-sample antialiasing, which is significantly cheaper but only smooths the edges of polygons.
**Note:** When using the **Nearest** scaling mode, to avoid uneven pixel scaling, it's highly recommended to use a value equal to an integer divisor with a dividend of `1`. For example, it's best to use a scale of `0.5` (1/2), `0.3333` (1/3), `0.25` (1/4), `0.2` (1/5), and so on.

> property rendering/shader_compiler/shader_cache/compress : bool ; default=true

> property rendering/shader_compiler/shader_cache/enabled : bool ; default=true

Enable the shader cache, which stores compiled shaders to disk to prevent stuttering from shader compilation the next time the shader is needed.

> property rendering/shader_compiler/shader_cache/strip_debug : bool ; default=false

> property rendering/shader_compiler/shader_cache/strip_debug.release : bool ; default=true

> property rendering/shader_compiler/shader_cache/use_zstd_compression : bool ; default=true

> property rendering/shading/overrides/force_lambert_over_burley : bool ; default=false

If `true`, uses faster but lower-quality Lambert material lighting model instead of Burley.

> property rendering/shading/overrides/force_lambert_over_burley.mobile : bool ; default=true

Lower-end override for `rendering/shading/overrides/force_lambert_over_burley` on mobile devices, due to performance concerns or driver support.

> property rendering/shading/overrides/force_vertex_shading : bool ; default=false

If `true`, forces vertex shading for all rendering. This can increase performance a lot, but also reduces quality immensely. Can be used to optimize performance on low-end mobile devices.

> property rendering/textures/basis_universal/rdo_dict_size : int ; default=1024

The dictionary size for Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) when importing textures as Basis Universal and when RDO is enabled, ranging from `64` to `65536`. Higher values reduce the file sizes further, but make encoding times significantly longer.

> property rendering/textures/basis_universal/zstd_supercompression : bool ; default=true

If `true`, enables Zstandard supercompression to reduce file size when importing textures as Basis Universal.
**Note:** Basis Universal textures need to be compressed to gain the benefit of smaller file sizes, otherwise they are as large as VRAM-compressed textures.

> property rendering/textures/basis_universal/zstd_supercompression_level : int ; default=6

Specify the compression level for Basis Universal Zstandard supercompression, ranging from `1` to `22`.

> property rendering/textures/canvas_textures/default_texture_filter : int ; default=1

The default texture filtering mode to use for `CanvasItem`s built-in texture. In shaders, this texture is accessed as `TEXTURE`.
**Note:** For pixel art aesthetics, see also `rendering/2d/snap/snap_2d_vertices_to_pixel` and `rendering/2d/snap/snap_2d_transforms_to_pixel`.

> property rendering/textures/canvas_textures/default_texture_repeat : int ; default=0

The default texture repeating mode to use for `CanvasItem`s built-in texture. In shaders, this texture is accessed as `TEXTURE`.

> property rendering/textures/decals/filter : int ; default=3

The filtering quality to use for `Decal` nodes. When using one of the anisotropic filtering modes, the anisotropic filtering level is controlled by `rendering/textures/default_filters/anisotropic_filtering_level`.

> property rendering/textures/default_filters/anisotropic_filtering_level : int ; default=2

Sets the maximum number of samples to take when using anisotropic filtering on textures (as a power of two). A higher sample count will result in sharper textures at oblique angles, but is more expensive to compute. A value of `0` forcibly disables anisotropic filtering, even on materials where it is enabled.
The anisotropic filtering level also affects decals and light projectors if they are configured to use anisotropic filtering. See `rendering/textures/decals/filter` and `rendering/textures/light_projectors/filter`.
**Note:** In 3D, for this setting to have an effect, set `BaseMaterial3D.texture_filter` to `BaseMaterial3D.TEXTURE_FILTER_LINEAR_WITH_MIPMAPS_ANISOTROPIC` or `BaseMaterial3D.TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST_WITH_MIPMAPS_ANISOTROPIC` on materials.
**Note:** In 2D, for this setting to have an effect, set `CanvasItem.texture_filter` to `CanvasItem.TEXTURE_FILTER_LINEAR_WITH_MIPMAPS_ANISOTROPIC` or `CanvasItem.TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST_WITH_MIPMAPS_ANISOTROPIC` on the `CanvasItem` node displaying the texture (or in `CanvasTexture`). However, anisotropic filtering is rarely useful in 2D, so only enable it for textures in 2D if it makes a meaningful visual difference.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To change the anisotropic filtering level at runtime, set `Viewport.anisotropic_filtering_level` on the root `Viewport` instead.

> property rendering/textures/default_filters/texture_mipmap_bias : float ; default=0.0

Affects the final texture sharpness by reading from a lower or higher mipmap (also called "texture LOD bias"). Negative values make mipmapped textures sharper but grainier when viewed at a distance, while positive values make mipmapped textures blurrier (even when up close).
Enabling temporal antialiasing (`rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/use_taa`) will automatically apply a `-0.5` offset to this value, while enabling FXAA (`rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/screen_space_aa`) will automatically apply a `-0.25` offset to this value. If both TAA and FXAA are enabled at the same time, an offset of `-0.75` is applied to this value.
**Note:** If `rendering/scaling_3d/scale` is lower than `1.0` (exclusive), `rendering/textures/default_filters/texture_mipmap_bias` is used to adjust the automatic mipmap bias which is calculated internally based on the scale factor. The formula for this is `log2(scaling_3d_scale) + mipmap_bias`.
**Note:** This property is only supported in the Forward+ and Mobile renderers, not Compatibility. In Compatibility, this property is always treated as if it was set to `0.0`.

> property rendering/textures/default_filters/use_nearest_mipmap_filter : bool ; default=false

If `true`, uses nearest-neighbor mipmap filtering when using mipmaps (also called "bilinear filtering"), which will result in visible seams appearing between mipmap stages. This may increase performance in mobile as less memory bandwidth is used. If `false`, linear mipmap filtering (also called "trilinear filtering") is used.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. There is currently no way to change this setting at run-time.

> property rendering/textures/light_projectors/filter : int ; default=3

The filtering quality to use for `OmniLight3D` and `SpotLight3D` projectors. When using one of the anisotropic filtering modes, the anisotropic filtering level is controlled by `rendering/textures/default_filters/anisotropic_filtering_level`.

> property rendering/textures/lossless_compression/force_png : bool ; default=false

If `true`, the texture importer will import lossless textures using the PNG format. Otherwise, it will default to using WebP.

> property rendering/textures/vram_compression/cache_gpu_compressor : bool ; default=true

If `true`, the GPU texture compressor will cache the local RenderingDevice and its resources (shaders and pipelines), making subsequent imports faster at the cost of increased memory usage.

> property rendering/textures/vram_compression/compress_with_gpu : bool ; default=true

If `true`, the texture importer will utilize the GPU for compressing textures, improving the import time of large images.
**Note:** This only functions on a device which supports either Vulkan, Direct3D 12, or Metal as a rendering driver.
**Note:** Currently this only affects certain compressed formats (BC1, BC3, BC4, BC5, and BC6), all of which are exclusive to desktop platforms and consoles.

> property rendering/textures/vram_compression/import_etc2_astc : bool ; default=false

If `true`, the texture importer will import VRAM-compressed textures using the Ericsson Texture Compression 2 algorithm for lower quality textures and normal maps and Adaptable Scalable Texture Compression algorithm for high quality textures (in 4×4 block size).
**Note:** This setting is an override. The texture importer will always import the format the host platform needs, even if this is set to `false`.
**Note:** Changing this setting does *not* impact textures that were already imported before. To make this setting apply to textures that were already imported, exit the editor, remove the `.godot/imported/` folder located inside the project folder then restart the editor (see `application/config/use_hidden_project_data_directory`).

> property rendering/textures/vram_compression/import_s3tc_bptc : bool ; default=false

If `true`, the texture importer will import VRAM-compressed textures using the S3 Texture Compression algorithm (DXT1-5) for lower quality textures and the BPTC algorithm (BC6H and BC7) for high quality textures. This algorithm is only supported on PC desktop platforms and consoles.
**Note:** This setting is an override. The texture importer will always import the format the host platform needs, even if this is set to `false`.
**Note:** Changing this setting does *not* impact textures that were already imported before. To make this setting apply to textures that were already imported, exit the editor, remove the `.godot/imported/` folder located inside the project folder then restart the editor (see `application/config/use_hidden_project_data_directory`).

> property rendering/textures/webp_compression/compression_method : int ; default=2

The default compression method for WebP. Affects both lossy and lossless WebP. A higher value results in smaller files at the cost of compression speed. Decompression speed is mostly unaffected by the compression method. Supported values are 0 to 6. Note that compression methods above 4 are very slow and offer very little savings.

> property rendering/textures/webp_compression/lossless_compression_factor : float ; default=25

The default compression factor for lossless WebP. Decompression speed is mostly unaffected by the compression factor. Supported values are 0 to 100.

> property rendering/viewport/hdr_2d : bool ; default=false

If `true`, enables `Viewport.use_hdr_2d` on the root Viewport. 2D rendering will use a high dynamic range (HDR) `RGBA16` format framebuffer. Additionally, 2D rendering will be performed on linear values and will be converted using the appropriate transfer function immediately before blitting to the screen.
Practically speaking, this means that the end result of the Viewport will not be clamped to the `0-1` range and can be used in 3D rendering without color encoding adjustments. This allows 2D rendering to take advantage of effects requiring high dynamic range (e.g. 2D glow) as well as substantially improves the appearance of effects requiring highly detailed gradients.
**Note:** This property is only read when the project starts. To toggle HDR 2D at runtime, set `Viewport.use_hdr_2d` on the root `Viewport`.

> property rendering/viewport/transparent_background : bool ; default=false

If `true`, enables `Viewport.transparent_bg` on the root viewport. This allows per-pixel transparency to be effective after also enabling `display/window/size/transparent` and `display/window/per_pixel_transparency/allowed`.

> property rendering/vrs/mode : int ; default=0

Set the default Variable Rate Shading (VRS) mode for the main viewport. See `Viewport.vrs_mode` to change this at runtime, and `Viewport.VRSMode` for possible values.

> property rendering/vrs/texture : String ; default=""

If `rendering/vrs/mode` is set to **Texture**, this is the path to default texture loaded as the VRS image.
The texture *must* use a lossless compression format so that colors can be matched precisely. The following VRS densities are mapped to various colors, with brighter colors representing a lower level of shading precision:

```text
            - 1×1 = rgb(0, 0, 0)     - #000000
            - 1×2 = rgb(0, 85, 0)    - #005500
            - 2×1 = rgb(85, 0, 0)    - #550000
            - 2×2 = rgb(85, 85, 0)   - #555500
            - 2×4 = rgb(85, 170, 0)  - #55aa00
            - 4×2 = rgb(170, 85, 0)  - #aa5500
            - 4×4 = rgb(170, 170, 0) - #aaaa00
            - 4×8 = rgb(170, 255, 0) - #aaff00 - Not supported on most hardware
            - 8×4 = rgb(255, 170, 0) - #ffaa00 - Not supported on most hardware
            - 8×8 = rgb(255, 255, 0) - #ffff00 - Not supported on most hardware

```

> property threading/worker_pool/low_priority_thread_ratio : float ; default=0.3

The ratio of `WorkerThreadPool`'s threads that will be reserved for low-priority tasks. For example, if 10 threads are available and this value is set to `0.3`, 3 of the worker threads will be reserved for low-priority tasks. The actual value won't exceed the number of CPU cores minus one, and if possible, at least one worker thread will be dedicated to low-priority tasks.

> property threading/worker_pool/max_threads : int ; default=-1

Maximum number of threads to be used by `WorkerThreadPool`. On Web, a value of `-1` means `1`. On other platforms, it means all *logical* CPU cores available (see `OS.get_processor_count`).

> property xr/openxr/binding_modifiers/analog_threshold : bool ; default=false

If `true`, enables the analog threshold binding modifier if supported by the XR runtime.

> property xr/openxr/binding_modifiers/dpad_binding : bool ; default=false

If `true`, enables the D-pad binding modifier if supported by the XR runtime.

> property xr/openxr/default_action_map : String ; default="res://openxr_action_map.tres"

Action map configuration to load by default.

> property xr/openxr/enabled : bool ; default=false

If `true`, Godot will setup and initialize OpenXR on startup.

> property xr/openxr/environment_blend_mode : int ; default="0"

Specify how OpenXR should blend in the environment. This is specific to certain AR and passthrough devices where camera images are blended in by the XR compositor.

> property xr/openxr/extensions/debug_message_types : int ; default="15"

Specifies the message types for which we request debug messages. Requires `xr/openxr/extensions/debug_utils` to be set and the extension to be supported by the XR runtime.

> property xr/openxr/extensions/debug_utils : int ; default="0"

Enables debug utilities on XR runtimes that supports the debug utils extension. Sets the maximum severity being reported (0 = disabled, 1 = error, 2 = warning, 3 = info, 4 = verbose).

> property xr/openxr/extensions/eye_gaze_interaction : bool ; default=false

Specify whether to enable eye tracking for this project. Depending on the platform, additional export configuration may be needed.

> property xr/openxr/extensions/frame_synthesis : bool ; default=false

If `true` the frame synthesis extension will be activated if supported by the platform.
**Note:** This feature should not be enabled in conjunction with Application Space Warp, if supported this replaces ASW.

> property xr/openxr/extensions/hand_interaction_profile : bool ; default=false

If `true` the hand interaction profile extension will be activated if supported by the platform.

> property xr/openxr/extensions/hand_tracking : bool ; default=false

If `true`, the hand tracking extension is enabled if available.
**Note:** By default hand tracking will only work for data sources chosen by the XR runtime. For SteamVR this is the controller inferred data source, for most other runtimes this is the unobstructed data source. There is no way to query this. If a runtime supports the OpenXR data source extension you can use the `xr/openxr/extensions/hand_tracking_controller_data_source` and/or `xr/openxr/extensions/hand_tracking_unobstructed_data_source` to indicate you wish to enable these data sources. If neither is selected the data source extension is not enabled and the XR runtimes default behavior persists.

> property xr/openxr/extensions/hand_tracking_controller_data_source : bool ; default=false

If `true`, support for the controller inferred data source is requested. If supported, you will receive hand tracking data even if the user has a controller in hand, with finger positions automatically inferred from controller input and/or sensors.
**Note:** This requires the OpenXR data source extension and controller inferred handtracking to be supported by the XR runtime. If not supported this setting will be ignored. `xr/openxr/extensions/hand_tracking` must be enabled for this setting to be used.

> property xr/openxr/extensions/hand_tracking_unobstructed_data_source : bool ; default=false

If `true`, support for the unobstructed data source is requested. If supported, you will receive hand tracking data based on the actual finger positions of the user often determined by optical tracking.
**Note:** This requires the OpenXR data source extension and unobstructed handtracking to be supported by the XR runtime. If not supported this setting will be ignored. `xr/openxr/extensions/hand_tracking` must be enabled for this setting to be used.

> property xr/openxr/extensions/render_model : bool ; default=false

If `true` we enable the render model extension if available.
**Note:** This relates to the core OpenXR render model extension and has no relation to any vendor render model extensions.

> property xr/openxr/extensions/spatial_entity/april_tag_dict : int ; default="3"

The April Tag marker types the built-in marker tracking is set to recognize (if April Tag marker tracking is available and enabled).

> property xr/openxr/extensions/spatial_entity/aruco_dict : int ; default="15"

The ArUco marker types the built-in marker tracking is set to recognize (if ArUco marker tracking is available and enabled).

> property xr/openxr/extensions/spatial_entity/enable_builtin_anchor_detection : bool ; default=false

If `true`, we enable the built-in logic for handling anchors. Godot will query (persistent) anchors and manage `OpenXRAnchorTracker` instances for you. If disabled you'll need to create your own spatial and persistence context and perform your own discovery queries.
**Note:** This functionality requires that spatial anchors are supported and enabled.

> property xr/openxr/extensions/spatial_entity/enable_builtin_marker_tracking : bool ; default=false

If `true`, we enable the built-in logic for handling marker tracking. Godot will query markers and manage `OpenXRMarkerTracker` instances for you. If disabled you'll need to create your own spatial context and perform your own discovery queries.
**Note:** This functionality requires that marker tracking is supported and enabled.

> property xr/openxr/extensions/spatial_entity/enable_builtin_plane_detection : bool ; default=false

If `true`, we enable the built-in logic for handling plane detection. Godot will query detected planes (walls, floors, ceilings, etc.) and manage `OpenXRPlaneTracker` instances for you. If disabled you'll need to create your own spatial context and perform your own discovery queries.
**Note:** This functionality requires that plane tracking is supported and enabled.

> property xr/openxr/extensions/spatial_entity/enable_marker_tracking : bool ; default=false

If `true`, support for the marker tracking extension is requested. If supported, you will be able to query information about markers detected by the XR runtime, e.g. QR codes, aruca markers and april tags.
**Note:** This requires that the OpenXR spatial entities and marker tracking extensions are supported by the XR runtime. If not supported this setting will be ignored. `xr/openxr/extensions/spatial_entity/enabled` must be enabled for this setting to be used.

> property xr/openxr/extensions/spatial_entity/enable_persistent_anchors : bool ; default=false

If `true`, support for the persistent anchors extension is requested. If supported, you will be able to store spatial anchors and they will be restored on application startup.
**Note:** This requires that the OpenXR spatial entities, spatial anchors, and spatial persistence extensions are supported by the XR runtime. If not supported this setting will be ignored. `xr/openxr/extensions/spatial_entity/enabled` and `xr/openxr/extensions/spatial_entity/enable_spatial_anchors` must be enabled for this setting to be used.

> property xr/openxr/extensions/spatial_entity/enable_plane_tracking : bool ; default=false

If `true`, support for the plane tracking extension is requested. If supported, you will be able to query information about planes detected by the XR runtime, e.g. walls, floors, etc.
**Note:** This requires that the OpenXR spatial entities and plane tracking extensions are supported by the XR runtime. If not supported this setting will be ignored. `xr/openxr/extensions/spatial_entity/enabled` must be enabled for this setting to be used.

> property xr/openxr/extensions/spatial_entity/enable_spatial_anchors : bool ; default=false

If `true`, support for the spatial anchors extension is requested. If supported, you will be able to register anchor locations in the real world that the XR runtime will adjust as needed and/or potentially share with other headsets.
**Note:** This requires that the OpenXR spatial entities and spatial anchors extensions are supported by the XR runtime. If not supported this setting will be ignored. `xr/openxr/extensions/spatial_entity/enabled` must be enabled for this setting to be used.

> property xr/openxr/extensions/spatial_entity/enabled : bool ; default=false

If `true`, support for the spatial entity extension is requested. If supported, you will be able to access spatial information about the real environment around you. What information is available is dependent on additional extensions.
**Note:** This requires that the OpenXR spatial entities extension is supported by the XR runtime. If not supported this setting will be ignored.

> property xr/openxr/extensions/user_presence : bool ; default=false

If `true`, the user presence extension is enabled if available.

> property xr/openxr/form_factor : int ; default="0"

Specify whether OpenXR should be configured for an HMD or a hand held device.

> property xr/openxr/foveation_dynamic : bool ; default=false

If `true` and foveation is supported, will automatically adjust foveation level based on framerate up to the level set on `xr/openxr/foveation_level`.

> property xr/openxr/foveation_eye_tracked : bool ; default=true

If `true` and foveation level is set to anything other than "Disabled", eye-tracked foveation will be used, so long as it's supported by the headset.

> property xr/openxr/foveation_level : int ; default="0"

Applied foveation level if supported.
**Note:** On platforms other than Android, if `rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/msaa_3d` is enabled, this feature will be disabled.

> property xr/openxr/foveation_with_subsampled_images : bool ; default=true

If `true` and foveation is also enabled, subsampled images will be used on Vulkan. This can improve the performance gain from foveated rendering, especially when using high foveation levels.
**Note:**: Using subsampled images is incompatible with many screen-space rendering features or post-processing effects like FXAA or glow. If any such effects are enabled, subsampled images will automatically be disabled and a warning shown in the log.

> property xr/openxr/reference_space : int ; default="1"

Specify the default reference space.

> property xr/openxr/startup_alert : bool ; default=true

If `true`, Godot will display an alert modal when OpenXR initialization fails on startup.

> property xr/openxr/submit_depth_buffer : bool ; default=false

If `true`, OpenXR will manage the depth buffer and use the depth buffer for advanced reprojection provided this is supported by the XR runtime. Note that some rendering features in Godot can't be used with this feature.

> property xr/openxr/target_api_version : String ; default=""

Optionally sets a specific API version of OpenXR to initialize in `major.minor.patch` notation. Some XR runtimes gate old behavior behind version checks. This is non-standard OpenXR behavior.

> property xr/openxr/view_configuration : int ; default="1"

Specify the view configuration with which to configure OpenXR setting up either Mono or Stereo rendering.

> property xr/shaders/enabled : bool ; default=false

If `true`, Godot will compile shaders required for XR.

## Methods

> method add_property_info(hint: Dictionary) -> void

Adds a custom property info to a property. The dictionary must contain:
- `"name"`: `String` (the property's name)
- `"type"`: `int` (see `Variant.Type`)
- optionally `"hint"`: `int` (see `PropertyHint`) and `"hint_string"`: `String`

```gdscript
                ProjectSettings.set("category/property_name", 0)

                var property_info = {
                    "name": "category/property_name",
                    "type": TYPE_INT,
                    "hint": PROPERTY_HINT_ENUM,
                    "hint_string": "one,two,three"
                }

                ProjectSettings.add_property_info(property_info)

```

```csharp
                ProjectSettings.Singleton.Set("category/property_name", 0);

                var propertyInfo = new Godot.Collections.Dictionary
                {
                    { "name", "category/propertyName" },
                    { "type", (int)Variant.Type.Int },
                    { "hint", (int)PropertyHint.Enum },
                    { "hint_string", "one,two,three" },
                };

                ProjectSettings.AddPropertyInfo(propertyInfo);

```

**Note:** Setting `"usage"` for the property is not supported. Use `set_as_basic`, `set_restart_if_changed`, and `set_as_internal` to modify usage flags.

> method check_changed_settings_in_group(setting_prefix: String) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Checks if any settings with the prefix `setting_prefix` exist in the set of changed settings. See also `get_changed_settings`.

> method clear(name: String) -> void

Clears the whole configuration (not recommended, may break things).

> method get_changed_settings() -> PackedStringArray ; qualifiers=const

Gets an array of the settings which have been changed since the last save. Note that internally `changed_settings` is cleared after a successful save, so generally the most appropriate place to use this method is when processing `settings_changed`.

> method get_global_class_list() -> Array[Dictionary]

Returns an `Array` of registered global classes. Each global class is represented as a `Dictionary` that contains the following entries:
- `base` is a name of the base class;
- `class` is a name of the registered global class;
- `icon` is a path to a custom icon of the global class, if it has any;
- `language` is a name of a programming language in which the global class is written;
- `path` is a path to a file containing the global class.
**Note:** Both the script and the icon paths are local to the project filesystem, i.e. they start with `res://`.

> method get_order(name: String) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the order of a configuration value (influences when saved to the config file).

> method get_setting(name: String, default_value: Variant = null) -> Variant ; qualifiers=const

Returns the value of the setting identified by `name`. If the setting doesn't exist and `default_value` is specified, the value of `default_value` is returned. Otherwise, `null` is returned.

```gdscript
                print(ProjectSettings.get_setting("application/config/name"))
                print(ProjectSettings.get_setting("application/config/custom_description", "No description specified."))

```

```csharp
                GD.Print(ProjectSettings.GetSetting("application/config/name"));
                GD.Print(ProjectSettings.GetSetting("application/config/custom_description", "No description specified."));

```

**Note:** This method doesn't take potential feature overrides into account automatically. Use `get_setting_with_override` to handle seamlessly.
See also `has_setting` to check whether a setting exists.

> method get_setting_with_override(name: StringName) -> Variant ; qualifiers=const

Similar to `get_setting`, but applies feature tag overrides if any exists and is valid.
**Example:** If the setting override `"application/config/name.windows"` exists, and the following code is executed on a *Windows* operating system, the overridden setting is printed instead:

```gdscript
                print(ProjectSettings.get_setting_with_override("application/config/name"))

```

```csharp
                GD.Print(ProjectSettings.GetSettingWithOverride("application/config/name"));

```

> method get_setting_with_override_and_custom_features(name: StringName, features: PackedStringArray) -> Variant ; qualifiers=const

Similar to `get_setting_with_override`, but applies feature tag overrides instead of current OS features.

> method globalize_path(path: String) -> String ; qualifiers=const

Returns the absolute, native OS path corresponding to the localized `path` (starting with `res://` or `user://`). The returned path will vary depending on the operating system and user preferences. See [File paths in Godot projects]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/io/data_paths.html) to see what those paths convert to. See also `localize_path`.
**Note:** `globalize_path` with `res://` will not work in an exported project. Instead, prepend the executable's base directory to the path when running from an exported project:

```text
                var path = ""
                if OS.has_feature("editor"):
                    # Running from an editor binary.
                    # `path` will contain the absolute path to `hello.txt` located in the project root.
                    path = ProjectSettings.globalize_path("res://hello.txt")
                else:
                    # Running from an exported project.
                    # `path` will contain the absolute path to `hello.txt` next to the executable.
                    # This is *not* identical to using `ProjectSettings.globalize_path()` with a `res://` path,
                    # but is close enough in spirit.
                    path = OS.get_executable_path().get_base_dir().path_join("hello.txt")

```

> method has_setting(name: String) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if a configuration value is present.
**Note:** In order to be be detected, custom settings have to be either defined with `set_setting`, or exist in the `project.godot` file. This is especially relevant when using `set_initial_value`.

> method load_resource_pack(pack: String, replace_files: bool = true, offset: int = 0) -> bool

Loads the contents of the .pck or .zip file specified by `pack` into the resource filesystem (`res://`). Returns `true` on success.
**Note:** If a file from `pack` shares the same path as a file already in the resource filesystem, any attempts to load that file will use the file from `pack` unless `replace_files` is set to `false`.
**Note:** The optional `offset` parameter can be used to specify the offset in bytes to the start of the resource pack. This is only supported for .pck files.
**Note:** `DirAccess` will not show changes made to the contents of `res://` after calling this function.

> method localize_path(path: String) -> String ; qualifiers=const

Returns the localized path (starting with `res://`) corresponding to the absolute, native OS `path`. See also `globalize_path`.

> method save() -> Error

Saves the configuration to the `project.godot` file.
**Note:** This method is intended to be used by editor plugins, as modified `ProjectSettings` can't be loaded back in the running app. If you want to change project settings in exported projects, use `save_custom` to save an `override.cfg` file.

> method save_custom(file: String) -> Error

Saves the configuration to a custom file. The file extension must be `.godot` (to save in text-based `ConfigFile` format) or `.binary` (to save in binary format). You can also save an `override.cfg` file, which is also text, but can be used in exported projects unlike other formats.

> method set_as_basic(name: String, basic: bool) -> void

Defines if the specified setting is considered basic or advanced. Basic settings will always be shown in the project settings. Advanced settings will only be shown if the user enables the "Advanced Settings" option.

> method set_as_internal(name: String, internal: bool) -> void

Defines if the specified setting is considered internal. An internal setting won't show up in the Project Settings dialog. This is mostly useful for addons that need to store their own internal settings without exposing them directly to the user.

> method set_initial_value(name: String, value: Variant) -> void

Sets the specified setting's initial value. This is the value the setting reverts to. The setting should already exist before calling this method. Note that project settings equal to their default value are not saved, so your code needs to account for that.

```text
                extends EditorPlugin

                const SETTING_NAME = "addons/my_setting"
                const SETTING_DEFAULT = 10.0

                func _enter_tree():
                    if not ProjectSettings.has_setting(SETTING_NAME):
                        ProjectSettings.set_setting(SETTING_NAME, SETTING_DEFAULT)

                    ProjectSettings.set_initial_value(SETTING_NAME, SETTING_DEFAULT)

```

If you have a project setting defined by an `EditorPlugin`, but want to use it in a running project, you will need a similar code at runtime.

> method set_order(name: String, position: int) -> void

Sets the order of a configuration value (influences when saved to the config file).

> method set_restart_if_changed(name: String, restart: bool) -> void

Sets whether a setting requires restarting the editor to properly take effect.
**Note:** This is just a hint to display to the user that the editor must be restarted for changes to take effect. Enabling `set_restart_if_changed` does *not* delay the setting being set when changed.

> method set_setting(name: String, value: Variant) -> void

Sets the value of a setting.

```gdscript
                ProjectSettings.set_setting("application/config/name", "Example")

```

```csharp
                ProjectSettings.SetSetting("application/config/name", "Example");

```

This can also be used to erase custom project settings. To do this change the setting value to `null`.

## Signals

> signal settings_changed()

Emitted when any setting is changed, up to once per process frame.
