# Vector4i

> class Vector4i

## Brief

A 4D vector using integer coordinates.

## Description

A 4-element structure that can be used to represent 4D grid coordinates or any other quadruplet of integers.
It uses integer coordinates and is therefore preferable to `Vector4` when exact precision is required. Note that the values are limited to 32 bits, and unlike `Vector4` this cannot be configured with an engine build option. Use `int` or `PackedInt64Array` if 64-bit values are needed.
**Note:** In a boolean context, a Vector4i will evaluate to `false` if it's equal to `Vector4i(0, 0, 0, 0)`. Otherwise, a Vector4i will always evaluate to `true`.

## Properties

> property w : int ; default=0

The vector's W component. Also accessible by using the index position `[3]`.

> property x : int ; default=0

The vector's X component. Also accessible by using the index position `[0]`.

> property y : int ; default=0

The vector's Y component. Also accessible by using the index position `[1]`.

> property z : int ; default=0

The vector's Z component. Also accessible by using the index position `[2]`.

## Constructors

> constructor Vector4i()

Constructs a default-initialized `Vector4i` with all components set to `0`.

> constructor Vector4i(from: Vector4i)

Constructs a `Vector4i` as a copy of the given `Vector4i`.

> constructor Vector4i(from: Vector4)

Constructs a new `Vector4i` from the given `Vector4` by truncating components' fractional parts (rounding towards zero). For a different behavior consider passing the result of `Vector4.ceil`, `Vector4.floor` or `Vector4.round` to this constructor instead.

> constructor Vector4i(x: int, y: int, z: int, w: int)

Returns a `Vector4i` with the given components.

## Methods

> method abs() -> Vector4i ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new vector with all components in absolute values (i.e. positive).

> method clamp(min: Vector4i, max: Vector4i) -> Vector4i ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new vector with all components clamped between the components of `min` and `max`, by running `@GlobalScope.clamp` on each component.

> method clampi(min: int, max: int) -> Vector4i ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new vector with all components clamped between `min` and `max`, by running `@GlobalScope.clamp` on each component.

> method distance_squared_to(to: Vector4i) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the squared [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) between this vector and `to`.
This method runs faster than `distance_to`, so prefer it if you need to compare vectors or need the squared distance for some formula.

> method distance_to(to: Vector4i) -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) between this vector and `to`.

> method length() -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the length (magnitude) of this vector.

> method length_squared() -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the squared length (squared magnitude) of this vector.
This method runs faster than `length`, so prefer it if you need to compare vectors or need the squared distance for some formula.

> method max(with: Vector4i) -> Vector4i ; qualifiers=const

Returns the component-wise maximum of this and `with`, equivalent to `Vector4i(maxi(x, with.x), maxi(y, with.y), maxi(z, with.z), maxi(w, with.w))`.

> method max_axis_index() -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the axis of the vector's highest value. See `AXIS_*` constants. If all components are equal, this method returns `AXIS_X`.

> method maxi(with: int) -> Vector4i ; qualifiers=const

Returns the component-wise maximum of this and `with`, equivalent to `Vector4i(maxi(x, with), maxi(y, with), maxi(z, with), maxi(w, with))`.

> method min(with: Vector4i) -> Vector4i ; qualifiers=const

Returns the component-wise minimum of this and `with`, equivalent to `Vector4i(mini(x, with.x), mini(y, with.y), mini(z, with.z), mini(w, with.w))`.

> method min_axis_index() -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the axis of the vector's lowest value. See `AXIS_*` constants. If all components are equal, this method returns `AXIS_W`.

> method mini(with: int) -> Vector4i ; qualifiers=const

Returns the component-wise minimum of this and `with`, equivalent to `Vector4i(mini(x, with), mini(y, with), mini(z, with), mini(w, with))`.

> method sign() -> Vector4i ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new vector with each component set to `1` if it's positive, `-1` if it's negative, and `0` if it's zero. The result is identical to calling `@GlobalScope.sign` on each component.

> method snapped(step: Vector4i) -> Vector4i ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new vector with each component snapped to the closest multiple of the corresponding component in `step`.

> method snappedi(step: int) -> Vector4i ; qualifiers=const

Returns a new vector with each component snapped to the closest multiple of `step`.

## Operators

Returns `true` if the vectors are not equal.

> operator %(right: Vector4i) -> Vector4i

Gets the remainder of each component of the `Vector4i` with the components of the given `Vector4i`. This operation uses truncated division, which is often not desired as it does not work well with negative numbers. Consider using `@GlobalScope.posmod` instead if you want to handle negative numbers.

```text
                print(Vector4i(10, -20, 30, -40) % Vector4i(7, 8, 9, 10)) # Prints (3, -4, 3, 0)

```

> operator %(right: int) -> Vector4i

Gets the remainder of each component of the `Vector4i` with the given `int`. This operation uses truncated division, which is often not desired as it does not work well with negative numbers. Consider using `@GlobalScope.posmod` instead if you want to handle negative numbers.

```text
                print(Vector4i(10, -20, 30, -40) % 7) # Prints (3, -6, 2, -5)

```

> operator *(right: Vector4i) -> Vector4i

Multiplies each component of the `Vector4i` by the components of the given `Vector4i`.

```

> operator *(right: float) -> Vector4

Returns a Vector4 value due to floating-point operations.

```text

```

> operator -(right: Vector4i) -> Vector4i

```

> operator /(right: float) -> Vector4

Returns a Vector4 value due to floating-point operations.

```text
                print(Vector4i(1, 2, 3, 4) / 2.5) # Prints (0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6)

```

> operator /(right: int) -> Vector4i

> operator <(right: Vector4i) -> bool

Compares two `Vector4i` vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is less than the X value of the `right` vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors, Z values of the two vectors, and then with the W values. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.

> operator <=(right: Vector4i) -> bool

Compares two `Vector4i` vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is less than or equal to the X value of the `right` vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors, Z values of the two vectors, and then with the W values. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.

> operator ==(right: Vector4i) -> bool

Returns `true` if the vectors are exactly equal.

> operator >(right: Vector4i) -> bool

Compares two `Vector4i` vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is greater than the X value of the `right` vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors, Z values of the two vectors, and then with the W values. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.

> operator >=(right: Vector4i) -> bool

Compares two `Vector4i` vectors by first checking if the X value of the left vector is greater than or equal to the X value of the `right` vector. If the X values are exactly equal, then it repeats this check with the Y values of the two vectors, Z values of the two vectors, and then with the W values. This operator is useful for sorting vectors.

> operator [](index: int) -> int

Access vector components using their `index`. `v[0]` is equivalent to `v.x`, `v[1]` is equivalent to `v.y`, `v[2]` is equivalent to `v.z`, and `v[3]` is equivalent to `v.w`.

> operator unary+() -> Vector4i

Returns the same value as if the `+` was not there. Unary `+` does nothing, but sometimes it can make your code more readable.

> operator unary-() -> Vector4i

Returns the negative value of the `Vector4i`. This is the same as writing `Vector4i(-v.x, -v.y, -v.z, -v.w)`. This operation flips the direction of the vector while keeping the same magnitude.
