# MultiMeshInstance2D

> class MultiMeshInstance2D ; keywords=batch

## Brief

Node that instances a `MultiMesh` in 2D.

## Description

`MultiMeshInstance2D` is a specialized node to instance a `MultiMesh` resource in 2D. This can be faster to render compared to displaying many `Sprite2D` nodes with large transparent areas, especially if the nodes take up a lot of space on screen at high viewport resolutions. This is because using a mesh designed to fit the sprites' opaque areas will reduce GPU fill rate utilization (at the cost of increased vertex processing utilization).
Usage is the same as `MultiMeshInstance3D`.

## Properties

> property multimesh : MultiMesh ; setter=set_multimesh ; getter=get_multimesh

The `MultiMesh` that will be drawn by the `MultiMeshInstance2D`.

> property texture : Texture2D ; setter=set_texture ; getter=get_texture

The `Texture2D` that will be used if using the default `CanvasItemMaterial`. Can be accessed as `TEXTURE` in CanvasItem shader.

## Signals

> signal texture_changed()

Emitted when the `texture` is changed.
