# Skeleton2D

> class Skeleton2D
> inherits Skeleton2D Node2D

## Brief

The parent of a hierarchy of `Bone2D`s, used to create a 2D skeletal animation.

## Description

`Skeleton2D` parents a hierarchy of `Bone2D` nodes. It holds a reference to each `Bone2D`'s rest pose and acts as a single point of access to its bones.
To set up different types of inverse kinematics for the given Skeleton2D, a `SkeletonModificationStack2D` should be created. The inverse kinematics be applied by increasing `SkeletonModificationStack2D.modification_count` and creating the desired number of modifications.

## Methods

> method execute_modifications(delta: float, execution_mode: int) -> void

Executes all the modifications on the `SkeletonModificationStack2D`, if the Skeleton2D has one assigned.

> method get_bone(idx: int) -> Bone2D

Returns a `Bone2D` from the node hierarchy parented by Skeleton2D. The object to return is identified by the parameter `idx`. Bones are indexed by descending the node hierarchy from top to bottom, adding the children of each branch before moving to the next sibling.

> method get_bone_count() -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the number of `Bone2D` nodes in the node hierarchy parented by Skeleton2D.

> method get_bone_local_pose_override(bone_idx: int) -> Transform2D

Returns the local pose override transform for `bone_idx`.

> method get_modification_stack() -> SkeletonModificationStack2D ; qualifiers=const

Returns the `SkeletonModificationStack2D` attached to this skeleton, if one exists.

> method get_skeleton() -> RID ; qualifiers=const

Returns the `RID` of a Skeleton2D instance.

> method set_bone_local_pose_override(bone_idx: int, override_pose: Transform2D, strength: float, persistent: bool) -> void

Sets the local pose transform, `override_pose`, for the bone at `bone_idx`.
`strength` is the interpolation strength that will be used when applying the pose, and `persistent` determines if the applied pose will remain.
**Note:** The pose transform needs to be a local transform relative to the `Bone2D` node at `bone_idx`!

> method set_modification_stack(modification_stack: SkeletonModificationStack2D) -> void

Sets the `SkeletonModificationStack2D` attached to this skeleton.

## Signals

> signal bone_setup_changed()

Emitted when the `Bone2D` setup attached to this skeletons changes. This is primarily used internally within the skeleton.
