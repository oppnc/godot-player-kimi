# GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D

> class GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D
> inherits GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D GPUParticlesCollision3D

## Brief

A real-time heightmap-shaped 3D particle collision shape affecting `GPUParticles3D` nodes.

## Description

A real-time heightmap-shaped 3D particle collision shape affecting `GPUParticles3D` nodes.
Heightmap shapes allow for efficiently representing collisions for convex and concave objects with a single "floor" (such as terrain). This is less flexible than `GPUParticlesCollisionSDF3D`, but it doesn't require a baking step.
`GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D` can also be regenerated in real-time when it is moved, when the camera moves, or even continuously. This makes `GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D` a good choice for weather effects such as rain and snow and games with highly dynamic geometry. However, this class is limited since heightmaps cannot represent overhangs (e.g. indoors or caves).
**Note:** `ParticleProcessMaterial.collision_mode` must be `true` on the `GPUParticles3D`'s process material for collision to work.
**Note:** Particle collision only affects `GPUParticles3D`, not `CPUParticles3D`.

## Properties

> property follow_camera_enabled : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_follow_camera_enabled ; getter=is_follow_camera_enabled

If `true`, the `GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D` will follow the current camera in global space. The `GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D` does not need to be a child of the `Camera3D` node for this to work.
Following the camera has a performance cost, as it will force the heightmap to update whenever the camera moves. Consider lowering `resolution` to improve performance if `follow_camera_enabled` is `true`.

> property heightfield_mask : int ; default=1048575 ; setter=set_heightfield_mask ; getter=get_heightfield_mask

The visual layers to account for when updating the heightmap. Only `MeshInstance3D`s whose `VisualInstance3D.layers` match with this `heightfield_mask` will be included in the heightmap collision update. By default, all 20 user-visible layers are taken into account for updating the heightmap collision.
**Note:** Since the `heightfield_mask` allows for 32 layers to be stored in total, there are an additional 12 layers that are only used internally by the engine and aren't exposed in the editor. Setting `heightfield_mask` using a script allows you to toggle those reserved layers, which can be useful for editor plugins.
To adjust `heightfield_mask` more easily using a script, use `get_heightfield_mask_value` and `set_heightfield_mask_value`.

> property resolution : Resolution ; default=2 ; setter=set_resolution ; getter=get_resolution

Higher resolutions can represent small details more accurately in large scenes, at the cost of lower performance. If `update_mode` is `UPDATE_MODE_ALWAYS`, consider using the lowest resolution possible.

> property size : Vector3 ; default=Vector3(2, 2, 2) ; setter=set_size ; getter=get_size

The collision heightmap's size in 3D units. To improve heightmap quality, `size` should be set as small as possible while covering the parts of the scene you need.

> property update_mode : UpdateMode ; default=0 ; setter=set_update_mode ; getter=get_update_mode

The update policy to use for the generated heightmap.

## Methods

> method get_heightfield_mask_value(layer_number: int) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the specified layer of the `heightfield_mask` is enabled, given a `layer_number` between `1` and `20`, inclusive.

> method set_heightfield_mask_value(layer_number: int, value: bool) -> void

Based on `value`, enables or disables the specified layer in the `heightfield_mask`, given a `layer_number` between `1` and `20`, inclusive.

## Enumerations

> enum Resolution

> enum_value Resolution.RESOLUTION_256 = 0

Generate a 256×256 heightmap. Intended for small-scale scenes, or larger scenes with no distant particles.

> enum_value Resolution.RESOLUTION_512 = 1

Generate a 512×512 heightmap. Intended for medium-scale scenes, or larger scenes with no distant particles.

> enum_value Resolution.RESOLUTION_1024 = 2

Generate a 1024×1024 heightmap. Intended for large scenes with distant particles.

> enum_value Resolution.RESOLUTION_2048 = 3

Generate a 2048×2048 heightmap. Intended for very large scenes with distant particles.

> enum_value Resolution.RESOLUTION_4096 = 4

Generate a 4096×4096 heightmap. Intended for huge scenes with distant particles.

> enum_value Resolution.RESOLUTION_8192 = 5

Generate a 8192×8192 heightmap. Intended for gigantic scenes with distant particles.

> enum_value Resolution.RESOLUTION_MAX = 6

Represents the size of the `Resolution` enum.

> enum UpdateMode

> enum_value UpdateMode.UPDATE_MODE_WHEN_MOVED = 0

Only update the heightmap when the `GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D` node is moved, or when the camera moves if `follow_camera_enabled` is `true`. An update can be forced by slightly moving the `GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D` in any direction, or by calling `RenderingServer.particles_collision_height_field_update`.

> enum_value UpdateMode.UPDATE_MODE_ALWAYS = 1

Update the heightmap every frame. This has a significant performance cost. This update should only be used when geometry that particles can collide with changes significantly during gameplay.
