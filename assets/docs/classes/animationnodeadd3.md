# AnimationNodeAdd3

> class AnimationNodeAdd3
> inherits AnimationNodeAdd3 AnimationNodeSync

## Brief

Blends two of three animations additively inside of an `AnimationNodeBlendTree`.

## Description

A resource to add to an `AnimationNodeBlendTree`. Blends two animations out of three additively out of three based on the amount value.
This animation node has three inputs:
- The base animation to add to
- A "-add" animation to blend with when the blend amount is negative
- A "+add" animation to blend with when the blend amount is positive
If the absolute value of the amount is greater than `1.0`, the animation connected to "in" port is blended with the amplified animation connected to "-add"/"+add" port.
**Note:** The signs are only used to distinguish ports, and additive blending occurs based on absolute values always, meaning the animation of a "-add" port does not subtract from the animation of an "in" port.
