## Brief

Triangle geometry for efficient, physicsless intersection queries.

## Description

Creates a bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) tree structure around triangle geometry.
The triangle BVH tree can be used for efficient intersection queries without involving a physics engine.
For example, this can be used in editor tools to select objects with complex shapes based on the mouse cursor position.
**Performance:** Creating the BVH tree for complex geometry is a slow process and best done in a background thread.

## Methods

> method create_from_faces(faces: PackedVector3Array) -> bool

Creates the BVH tree from an array of faces. Each 3 vertices of the input `faces` array represent one triangle (face).
Returns `true` if the tree is successfully built, `false` otherwise.

> method get_faces() -> PackedVector3Array ; qualifiers=const

Returns a copy of the geometry faces. Each 3 vertices of the array represent one triangle (face).

> method intersect_ray(begin: Vector3, dir: Vector3) -> Dictionary ; qualifiers=const

Tests for intersection with a ray starting at `begin` and facing `dir` and extending toward infinity.
If an intersection with a triangle happens, returns a `Dictionary` with the following fields:
`position`: The position on the intersected triangle.
`normal`: The normal of the intersected triangle.
`face_index`: The index of the intersected triangle.
Returns an empty `Dictionary` if no intersection happens.
See also `intersect_segment`, which is similar but uses a finite-length segment.

> method intersect_segment(begin: Vector3, end: Vector3) -> Dictionary ; qualifiers=const

Tests for intersection with a segment going from `begin` to `end`.
If an intersection with a triangle happens returns a `Dictionary` with the following fields:
`position`: The position on the intersected triangle.
`normal`: The normal of the intersected triangle.
`face_index`: The index of the intersected triangle.
Returns an empty `Dictionary` if no intersection happens.
See also `intersect_ray`, which is similar but uses an infinite-length ray.
