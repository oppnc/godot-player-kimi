# EditorFeatureProfile

> class EditorFeatureProfile
> inherits EditorFeatureProfile RefCounted

## Brief

An editor feature profile which can be used to disable specific features.

## Description

An editor feature profile can be used to disable specific features of the Godot editor. When disabled, the features won't appear in the editor, which makes the editor less cluttered. This is useful in education settings to reduce confusion or when working in a team. For example, artists and level designers could use a feature profile that disables the script editor to avoid accidentally making changes to files they aren't supposed to edit.
To manage editor feature profiles visually, use **Editor > Manage Feature Profiles...** at the top of the editor window.
