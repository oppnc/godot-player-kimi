# Node3DGizmo

## Brief

Abstract class to expose editor gizmos for `Node3D`.

## Description

This abstract class helps connect the `Node3D` scene with the editor-specific `EditorNode3DGizmo` class.
`Node3DGizmo` by itself has no exposed API, refer to `Node3D.add_gizmo` and pass it an `EditorNode3DGizmo` instance.
