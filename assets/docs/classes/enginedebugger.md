# EngineDebugger

> class EngineDebugger
> inherits EngineDebugger Object

## Brief

Exposes the internal debugger.

## Description

`EngineDebugger` handles the communication between the editor and the running game. It is active in the running game. Messages can be sent/received through it. It also manages the profilers.

## Methods

> method clear_breakpoints() -> void

Clears all breakpoints.

> method debug(can_continue: bool = true, is_error_breakpoint: bool = false) -> void

Starts a debug break in script execution, optionally specifying whether the program can continue based on `can_continue` and whether the break was due to a breakpoint.

> method get_depth() -> int ; qualifiers=const ; experimental=This method may be changed or removed in future versions.

Returns the current debug depth.

> method get_lines_left() -> int ; qualifiers=const ; experimental=This method may be changed or removed in future versions.

Returns the number of lines that remain.

> method has_capture(name: StringName) -> bool

Returns `true` if a capture with the given name is present otherwise `false`.

> method has_profiler(name: StringName) -> bool

Returns `true` if a profiler with the given name is present otherwise `false`.

> method insert_breakpoint(line: int, source: StringName) -> void

Inserts a new breakpoint with the given `source` and `line`.

> method is_active() -> bool

Returns `true` if the debugger is active otherwise `false`.

> method is_breakpoint(line: int, source: StringName) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the given `source` and `line` represent an existing breakpoint.

> method is_profiling(name: StringName) -> bool

Returns `true` if a profiler with the given name is present and active otherwise `false`.

> method is_skipping_breakpoints() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the debugger is skipping breakpoints otherwise `false`.

> method line_poll() -> void

Forces a processing loop of debugger events. The purpose of this method is just processing events every now and then when the script might get too busy, so that bugs like infinite loops can be caught.

> method profiler_add_frame_data(name: StringName, data: Array) -> void

Calls the `add` callable of the profiler with given `name` and `data`.

> method profiler_enable(name: StringName, enable: bool, arguments: Array = []) -> void

Calls the `toggle` callable of the profiler with given `name` and `arguments`. Enables/Disables the same profiler depending on `enable` argument.

> method register_message_capture(name: StringName, callable: Callable) -> void

Registers a message capture with given `name`. If `name` is "my_message" then messages starting with "my_message:" will be called with the given callable.
The callable must accept a message string and a data array as argument. The callable should return `true` if the message is recognized.
**Note:** The callable will receive the message with the prefix stripped, unlike `EditorDebuggerPlugin._capture`. See the `EditorDebuggerPlugin` description for an example.

> method register_profiler(name: StringName, profiler: EngineProfiler) -> void

Registers a profiler with the given `name`. See `EngineProfiler` for more information.

> method remove_breakpoint(line: int, source: StringName) -> void

Removes a breakpoint with the given `source` and `line`.

> method script_debug(language: ScriptLanguage, can_continue: bool = true, is_error_breakpoint: bool = false) -> void

Starts a debug break in script execution, optionally specifying whether the program can continue based on `can_continue` and whether the break was due to a breakpoint.

> method send_message(message: String, data: Array) -> void

Sends a message with given `message` and `data` array.

> method set_depth(depth: int) -> void ; experimental=This method may be changed or removed in future versions.

Sets the current debugging depth.

> method set_lines_left(lines: int) -> void ; experimental=This method may be changed or removed in future versions.

Sets the current debugging lines that remain.

> method unregister_message_capture(name: StringName) -> void

Unregisters the message capture with given `name`.

> method unregister_profiler(name: StringName) -> void

Unregisters a profiler with given `name`.
