# XRNode3D

> class XRNode3D
> inherits XRNode3D Node3D

## Brief

A 3D node that has its position automatically updated by the `XRServer`.

## Description

This node can be bound to a specific pose of an `XRPositionalTracker` and will automatically have its `Node3D.transform` updated by the `XRServer`. Nodes of this type must be added as children of the `XROrigin3D` node.

## Properties

> property physics_interpolation_mode : Node.PhysicsInterpolationMode ; default=2 ; setter=set_physics_interpolation_mode ; getter=get_physics_interpolation_mode ; overrides=Node

> property pose : StringName ; default=&"default" ; setter=set_pose_name ; getter=get_pose_name

The name of the pose we're bound to. Which poses a tracker supports is not known during design time.
Godot defines number of standard pose names such as `aim` and `grip` but other may be configured within a given `XRInterface`.

> property show_when_tracked : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_show_when_tracked ; getter=get_show_when_tracked

Enables showing the node when tracking starts, and hiding the node when tracking is lost.

> property tracker : StringName ; default=&"" ; setter=set_tracker ; getter=get_tracker

The name of the tracker we're bound to. Which trackers are available is not known during design time.
Godot defines a number of standard trackers such as `left_hand` and `right_hand` but others may be configured within a given `XRInterface`.

## Methods

> method get_has_tracking_data() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the `tracker` has current tracking data for the `pose` being tracked.

> method get_is_active() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the `tracker` has been registered and the `pose` is being tracked.

> method get_pose() -> XRPose

Returns the `XRPose` containing the current state of the pose being tracked. This gives access to additional properties of this pose.

> method trigger_haptic_pulse(action_name: String, frequency: float, amplitude: float, duration_sec: float, delay_sec: float) -> void

Triggers a haptic pulse on a device associated with this interface.
`action_name` is the name of the action for this pulse.
`frequency` is the frequency of the pulse, set to `0.0` to have the system use a default frequency.
`amplitude` is the amplitude of the pulse between `0.0` and `1.0`.
`duration_sec` is the duration of the pulse in seconds.
`delay_sec` is a delay in seconds before the pulse is given.

## Signals

> signal tracking_changed(tracking: bool)

Emitted when the `tracker` starts or stops receiving updated tracking data for the `pose` being tracked. The `tracking` argument indicates whether the tracker is getting updated tracking data.
