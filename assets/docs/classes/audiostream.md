## Brief

Base class for audio streams.

## Description

Base class for audio streams. Audio streams are used for sound effects and music playback, and support WAV (via `AudioStreamWAV`), Ogg (via `AudioStreamOggVorbis`), and MP3 (via `AudioStreamMP3`) file formats.

## Methods

> method _get_bar_beats() -> int ; qualifiers=virtual const

Override this method to return the bar beats of this stream.

> method _get_beat_count() -> int ; qualifiers=virtual const

Overridable method. Should return the total number of beats of this audio stream. Used by the engine to determine the position of every beat.
Ideally, the returned value should be based off the stream's sample rate (`AudioStreamWAV.mix_rate`, for example).

> method _get_bpm() -> float ; qualifiers=virtual const

Overridable method. Should return the tempo of this audio stream, in beats per minute (BPM). Used by the engine to determine the position of every beat.
Ideally, the returned value should be based off the stream's sample rate (`AudioStreamWAV.mix_rate`, for example).

> method _get_length() -> float ; qualifiers=virtual const

Override this method to customize the returned value of `get_length`. Should return the length of this audio stream, in seconds.

> method _get_parameter_list() -> Array[Dictionary] ; qualifiers=virtual const

Return the controllable parameters of this stream. This array contains dictionaries with a property info description format (see `Object.get_property_list`). Additionally, the default value for this parameter must be added tho each dictionary in "default_value" field.

> method _get_stream_name() -> String ; qualifiers=virtual const

Override this method to customize the name assigned to this audio stream. Unused by the engine.

> method _get_tags() -> Dictionary ; qualifiers=virtual const

Override this method to customize the tags for this audio stream. Should return a `Dictionary` of strings with the tag as the key and its content as the value.
Commonly used tags include `title`, `artist`, `album`, `tracknumber`, and `date`.

> method _has_loop() -> bool ; qualifiers=virtual const

Override this method to return `true` if this stream has a loop.

> method _instantiate_playback() -> AudioStreamPlayback ; qualifiers=virtual required const

Override this method to customize the returned value of `instantiate_playback`. Should return a new `AudioStreamPlayback` created when the stream is played (such as by an `AudioStreamPlayer`).

> method _is_monophonic() -> bool ; qualifiers=virtual const

Override this method to customize the returned value of `is_monophonic`. Should return `true` if this audio stream only supports one channel.

> method can_be_sampled() -> bool ; qualifiers=const ; experimental=This method may be changed or removed in future versions.

Returns if the current `AudioStream` can be used as a sample. Only static streams can be sampled.

> method generate_sample() -> AudioSample ; qualifiers=const ; experimental=This method may be changed or removed in future versions.

Generates an `AudioSample` based on the current stream.

> method get_length() -> float ; qualifiers=const

Returns the length of the audio stream in seconds. If this stream is an `AudioStreamRandomizer`, returns the length of the last played stream. If this stream has an indefinite length (such as for `AudioStreamGenerator` and `AudioStreamMicrophone`), returns `0.0`.

> method instantiate_playback() -> AudioStreamPlayback

Returns a newly created `AudioStreamPlayback` intended to play this audio stream. Useful for when you want to extend `_instantiate_playback` but call `instantiate_playback` from an internally held AudioStream subresource. An example of this can be found in the source code for `AudioStreamRandomPitch::instantiate_playback`.

> method is_meta_stream() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the stream is a collection of other streams, `false` otherwise.

> method is_monophonic() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this audio stream only supports one channel (*monophony*), or `false` if the audio stream supports two or more channels (*polyphony*).

## Signals

> signal parameter_list_changed()

Signal to be emitted to notify when the parameter list changed.
