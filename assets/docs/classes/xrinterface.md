# XRInterface

> class XRInterface
> inherits XRInterface RefCounted

## Brief

Base class for an XR interface implementation.

## Description

This class needs to be implemented to make an AR or VR platform available to Godot and these should be implemented as C++ modules or GDExtension modules. Part of the interface is exposed to GDScript so you can detect, enable and configure an AR or VR platform.
Interfaces should be written in such a way that simply enabling them will give us a working setup. You can query the available interfaces through `XRServer`.

## Properties

> property ar_is_anchor_detection_enabled : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_anchor_detection_is_enabled ; getter=get_anchor_detection_is_enabled

On an AR interface, `true` if anchor detection is enabled.

> property environment_blend_mode : EnvironmentBlendMode ; default=0 ; setter=set_environment_blend_mode ; getter=get_environment_blend_mode

Specify how XR should blend in the environment. This is specific to certain AR and passthrough devices where camera images are blended in by the XR compositor.

> property interface_is_primary : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_primary ; getter=is_primary

`true` if this is the primary interface.

> property xr_play_area_mode : PlayAreaMode ; default=0 ; setter=set_play_area_mode ; getter=get_play_area_mode

The play area mode for this interface.

## Methods

> method get_camera_feed_id() -> int

If this is an AR interface that requires displaying a camera feed as the background, this method returns the feed ID in the `CameraServer` for this interface.

> method get_capabilities() -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns a combination of `Capabilities` flags providing information about the capabilities of this interface.

> method get_name() -> StringName ; qualifiers=const

Returns the name of this interface (`"OpenXR"`, `"OpenVR"`, `"OpenHMD"`, `"ARKit"`, etc.).

> method get_play_area() -> PackedVector3Array ; qualifiers=const

Returns an array of vectors that represent the physical play area mapped to the virtual space around the `XROrigin3D` point. The points form a convex polygon that can be used to react to or visualize the play area. This returns an empty array if this feature is not supported or if the information is not yet available.

> method get_projection_for_view(view: int, aspect: float, near: float, far: float) -> Projection

Returns the projection matrix for a view/eye.

> method get_render_target_size() -> Vector2

Returns the resolution at which we should render our intermediate results before things like lens distortion are applied by the VR platform.

> method get_supported_environment_blend_modes() -> Array

Returns the an array of supported environment blend modes, see `XRInterface.EnvironmentBlendMode`.

> method get_system_info() -> Dictionary

Returns a `Dictionary` with extra system info. Interfaces are expected to return `XRRuntimeName` and `XRRuntimeVersion` providing info about the used XR runtime. Additional entries may be provided specific to an interface.
**Note:**This information may only be available after `initialize` was successfully called.

> method get_tracking_status() -> TrackingStatus ; qualifiers=const

If supported, returns the status of our tracking. This will allow you to provide feedback to the user whether there are issues with positional tracking.

> method get_transform_for_view(view: int, cam_transform: Transform3D) -> Transform3D

Returns the transform for a view/eye.
`view` is the view/eye index.
`cam_transform` is the transform that maps device coordinates to scene coordinates, typically the `Node3D.global_transform` of the current XROrigin3D.

> method get_view_count() -> int

Returns the number of views that need to be rendered for this device. 1 for Monoscopic, 2 for Stereoscopic.

> method initialize() -> bool

Call this to initialize this interface. The first interface that is initialized is identified as the primary interface and it will be used for rendering output.
After initializing the interface you want to use you then need to enable the AR/VR mode of a viewport and rendering should commence.
**Note:** You must enable the XR mode on the main viewport for any device that uses the main output of Godot, such as for mobile VR.
If you do this for a platform that handles its own output (such as OpenVR) Godot will show just one eye without distortion on screen. Alternatively, you can add a separate viewport node to your scene and enable AR/VR on that viewport. It will be used to output to the HMD, leaving you free to do anything you like in the main window, such as using a separate camera as a spectator camera or rendering something completely different.
While currently not used, you can activate additional interfaces. You may wish to do this if you want to track controllers from other platforms. However, at this point in time only one interface can render to an HMD.

> method is_initialized() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this interface has been initialized.

> method is_passthrough_enabled() -> bool ; deprecated=Check if `environment_blend_mode` is `XRInterface.XR_ENV_BLEND_MODE_ALPHA_BLEND`, instead.

Returns `true` if passthrough is enabled.

> method is_passthrough_supported() -> bool ; deprecated=Check that `XRInterface.XR_ENV_BLEND_MODE_ALPHA_BLEND` is supported using `get_supported_environment_blend_modes`, instead.

Returns `true` if this interface supports passthrough.

> method set_environment_blend_mode(mode: EnvironmentBlendMode) -> bool

Sets the active environment blend mode.
`mode` is the environment blend mode starting with the next frame.
**Note:** Not all runtimes support all environment blend modes, so it is important to check this at startup. For example:

```text
                func _ready():
                    var xr_interface = XRServer.find_interface("OpenXR")
                    if xr_interface and xr_interface.is_initialized():
                        var vp = get_viewport()
                        vp.use_xr = true
                        var acceptable_modes = [XRInterface.XR_ENV_BLEND_MODE_OPAQUE, XRInterface.XR_ENV_BLEND_MODE_ADDITIVE]
                        var modes = xr_interface.get_supported_environment_blend_modes()
                        for mode in acceptable_modes:
                            if mode in modes:
                                xr_interface.set_environment_blend_mode(mode)
                                break

```

> method set_play_area_mode(mode: PlayAreaMode) -> bool

Sets the active play area mode, will return `false` if the mode can't be used with this interface.
**Note:** Changing this after the interface has already been initialized can be jarring for the player, so it's recommended to recenter on the HMD with `XRServer.center_on_hmd` (if switching to `XRInterface.XR_PLAY_AREA_STAGE`) or make the switch during a scene change.

> method start_passthrough() -> bool ; deprecated=Set the `environment_blend_mode` to `XRInterface.XR_ENV_BLEND_MODE_ALPHA_BLEND`, instead.

Starts passthrough, will return `false` if passthrough couldn't be started.
**Note:** The viewport used for XR must have a transparent background, otherwise passthrough may not properly render.

> method stop_passthrough() -> void ; deprecated=Set the `environment_blend_mode` to `XRInterface.XR_ENV_BLEND_MODE_OPAQUE`, instead.

Stops passthrough.

> method supports_play_area_mode(mode: PlayAreaMode) -> bool

Call this to find out if a given play area mode is supported by this interface.

> method trigger_haptic_pulse(action_name: String, tracker_name: StringName, frequency: float, amplitude: float, duration_sec: float, delay_sec: float) -> void

Triggers a haptic pulse on a device associated with this interface.
`action_name` is the name of the action for this pulse.
`tracker_name` is optional and can be used to direct the pulse to a specific device provided that device is bound to this haptic.
`frequency` is the frequency of the pulse, set to `0.0` to have the system use a default frequency.
`amplitude` is the amplitude of the pulse between `0.0` and `1.0`.
`duration_sec` is the duration of the pulse in seconds.
`delay_sec` is a delay in seconds before the pulse is given.

> method uninitialize() -> void

Turns the interface off.

## Signals

> signal play_area_changed(mode: int)

Emitted when the play area is changed. This can be a result of the player resetting the boundary or entering a new play area, the player changing the play area mode, the world scale changing or the player resetting their headset orientation.

## Enumerations

> enum Capabilities

> enum_value Capabilities.XR_NONE = 0

No XR capabilities.

> enum_value Capabilities.XR_MONO = 1

This interface can work with normal rendering output (non-HMD based AR).

> enum_value Capabilities.XR_STEREO = 2

This interface supports stereoscopic rendering.

> enum_value Capabilities.XR_QUAD = 4

This interface supports quad rendering (not yet supported by Godot).

> enum_value Capabilities.XR_VR = 8

This interface supports VR.

> enum_value Capabilities.XR_AR = 16

This interface supports AR (video background and real world tracking).

> enum_value Capabilities.XR_EXTERNAL = 32

This interface outputs to an external device. If the main viewport is used, the on screen output is an unmodified buffer of either the left or right eye (stretched if the viewport size is not changed to the same aspect ratio of `get_render_target_size`). Using a separate viewport node frees up the main viewport for other purposes.

> enum EnvironmentBlendMode

> enum_value EnvironmentBlendMode.XR_ENV_BLEND_MODE_OPAQUE = 0

Opaque blend mode. This is typically used for VR devices.

> enum_value EnvironmentBlendMode.XR_ENV_BLEND_MODE_ADDITIVE = 1

Additive blend mode. This is typically used for AR devices or VR devices with passthrough.

> enum_value EnvironmentBlendMode.XR_ENV_BLEND_MODE_ALPHA_BLEND = 2

Alpha blend mode. This is typically used for AR or VR devices with passthrough capabilities. The alpha channel controls how much of the passthrough is visible. Alpha of 0.0 means the passthrough is visible and this pixel works in ADDITIVE mode. Alpha of 1.0 means that the passthrough is not visible and this pixel works in OPAQUE mode.

> enum PlayAreaMode

> enum_value PlayAreaMode.XR_PLAY_AREA_UNKNOWN = 0

Play area mode not set or not available.

> enum_value PlayAreaMode.XR_PLAY_AREA_3DOF = 1

Play area only supports orientation tracking, no positional tracking, area will center around player.

> enum_value PlayAreaMode.XR_PLAY_AREA_SITTING = 2

Player is in seated position, limited positional tracking, fixed guardian around player.

> enum_value PlayAreaMode.XR_PLAY_AREA_ROOMSCALE = 3

Player is free to move around, full positional tracking.

> enum_value PlayAreaMode.XR_PLAY_AREA_STAGE = 4

Same as `XR_PLAY_AREA_ROOMSCALE` but origin point is fixed to the center of the physical space. In this mode, system-level recentering may be disabled, requiring the use of `XRServer.center_on_hmd`.

> enum_value PlayAreaMode.XR_PLAY_AREA_CUSTOM = 2147483647

Custom play area set by a GDExtension.

> enum TrackingStatus

> enum_value TrackingStatus.XR_NORMAL_TRACKING = 0

Tracking is behaving as expected.

> enum_value TrackingStatus.XR_EXCESSIVE_MOTION = 1

Tracking is hindered by excessive motion (the player is moving faster than tracking can keep up).

> enum_value TrackingStatus.XR_INSUFFICIENT_FEATURES = 2

Tracking is hindered by insufficient features, it's too dark (for camera-based tracking), player is blocked, etc.

> enum_value TrackingStatus.XR_UNKNOWN_TRACKING = 3

We don't know the status of the tracking or this interface does not provide feedback.

> enum_value TrackingStatus.XR_NOT_TRACKING = 4

Tracking is not functional (camera not plugged in or obscured, lighthouses turned off, etc.).

> enum VRSTextureFormat

> enum_value VRSTextureFormat.XR_VRS_TEXTURE_FORMAT_UNIFIED = 0

The texture format is the same as returned by `XRVRS.make_vrs_texture`.

> enum_value VRSTextureFormat.XR_VRS_TEXTURE_FORMAT_FRAGMENT_SHADING_RATE = 1

The texture format is the same as expected by the Vulkan `VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate` extension.

> enum_value VRSTextureFormat.XR_VRS_TEXTURE_FORMAT_FRAGMENT_DENSITY_MAP = 2

The texture format is the same as expected by the Vulkan `VK_EXT_fragment_density_map` extension.
