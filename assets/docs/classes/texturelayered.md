# TextureLayered

> class TextureLayered
> inherits TextureLayered Texture

## Brief

Base class for texture types which contain the data of multiple `Image`s. Each image is of the same size and format.

## Description

Base class for `ImageTextureLayered` and `CompressedTextureLayered`. Cannot be used directly, but contains all the functions necessary for accessing the derived resource types. See also `Texture3D`.
Data is set on a per-layer basis. For `Texture2DArray`s, the layer specifies the array layer.
All images need to have the same width, height and number of mipmap levels.
A `TextureLayered` can be loaded with `ResourceLoader.load`.
Internally, Godot maps these files to their respective counterparts in the target rendering driver (Vulkan, OpenGL3).

## Methods

> method _get_format() -> Image.Format ; qualifiers=virtual required const

Called when the `TextureLayered`'s format is queried.

> method _get_height() -> int ; qualifiers=virtual required const

Called when the `TextureLayered`'s height is queried.

> method _get_layer_data(layer_index: int) -> Image ; qualifiers=virtual required const

Called when the data for a layer in the `TextureLayered` is queried.

> method _get_layered_type() -> int ; qualifiers=virtual required const

Called when the layers' type in the `TextureLayered` is queried.

> method _get_layers() -> int ; qualifiers=virtual required const

Called when the number of layers in the `TextureLayered` is queried.

> method _get_width() -> int ; qualifiers=virtual required const

Called when the `TextureLayered`'s width queried.

> method _has_mipmaps() -> bool ; qualifiers=virtual required const

Called when the presence of mipmaps in the `TextureLayered` is queried.

> method get_format() -> Image.Format ; qualifiers=const

Returns the current format being used by this texture.

> method get_height() -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the height of the texture in pixels. Height is typically represented by the Y axis.

> method get_layer_data(layer: int) -> Image ; qualifiers=const

Returns an `Image` resource with the data from specified `layer`.

> method get_layered_type() -> LayeredType ; qualifiers=const

Returns the `TextureLayered`'s type. The type determines how the data is accessed, with cubemaps having special types.

> method get_layers() -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the number of referenced `Image`s.

> method get_width() -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the width of the texture in pixels. Width is typically represented by the X axis.

> method has_mipmaps() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the layers have generated mipmaps.

## Enumerations

> enum LayeredType

> enum_value LayeredType.LAYERED_TYPE_2D_ARRAY = 0

Texture is a generic `Texture2DArray`.

> enum_value LayeredType.LAYERED_TYPE_CUBEMAP = 1

Texture is a `Cubemap`, with each side in its own layer (6 in total).

> enum_value LayeredType.LAYERED_TYPE_CUBEMAP_ARRAY = 2

Texture is a `CubemapArray`, with each cubemap being made of 6 layers.
