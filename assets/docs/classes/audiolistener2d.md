# AudioListener2D

> class AudioListener2D ; keywords=sound
> inherits AudioListener2D Node2D

## Brief

Overrides the location sounds are heard from.

## Description

Once added to the scene tree and enabled using `make_current`, this node will override the location sounds are heard from. Only one `AudioListener2D` can be current. Using `make_current` will disable the previous `AudioListener2D`.
If there is no active `AudioListener2D` in the current `Viewport`, center of the screen will be used as a hearing point for the audio. `AudioListener2D` needs to be inside `SceneTree` to function.

## Methods

> method clear_current() -> void

Disables the `AudioListener2D`. If it's not set as current, this method will have no effect.

> method is_current() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this `AudioListener2D` is currently active.

> method make_current() -> void

Makes the `AudioListener2D` active, setting it as the hearing point for the sounds. If there is already another active `AudioListener2D`, it will be disabled.
This method will have no effect if the `AudioListener2D` is not added to `SceneTree`.
