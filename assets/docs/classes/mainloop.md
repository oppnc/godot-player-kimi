## Brief

Abstract base class for the game's main loop.

## Description

`MainLoop` is the abstract base class for a Godot project's game loop. It is inherited by `SceneTree`, which is the default game loop implementation used in Godot projects, though it is also possible to write and use one's own `MainLoop` subclass instead of the scene tree.
Upon the application start, a `MainLoop` implementation must be provided to the OS; otherwise, the application will exit. This happens automatically (and a `SceneTree` is created) unless a `MainLoop` `Script` is provided from the command line (with e.g. `godot -s my_loop.gd`) or the `ProjectSettings.application/run/main_loop_type` project setting is overwritten.
Here is an example script implementing a simple `MainLoop`:

```gdscript
        class_name CustomMainLoop
        extends MainLoop

        var time_elapsed = 0

        func _initialize():
            print("Initialized:")
            print("  Starting time: %s" % str(time_elapsed))

        func _process(delta):
            time_elapsed += delta
            # Return true to end the main loop.
            return Input.get_mouse_button_mask() != 0 || Input.is_key_pressed(KEY_ESCAPE)

        func _finalize():
            print("Finalized:")
            print("  End time: %s" % str(time_elapsed))

```

```csharp
        using Godot;

        [GlobalClass]
        public partial class CustomMainLoop : MainLoop
        {
            private double _timeElapsed = 0;

            public override void _Initialize()
            {
                GD.Print("Initialized:");
                GD.Print($"  Starting Time: {_timeElapsed}");
            }

            public override bool _Process(double delta)
            {
                _timeElapsed += delta;
                // Return true to end the main loop.
                return Input.GetMouseButtonMask() != 0 || Input.IsKeyPressed(Key.Escape);
            }

            private void _Finalize()
            {
                GD.Print("Finalized:");
                GD.Print($"  End Time: {_timeElapsed}");
            }
        }

```

## Methods

> method _finalize() -> void ; qualifiers=virtual

Called before the program exits.

> method _initialize() -> void ; qualifiers=virtual

Called once during initialization.

> method _physics_process(delta: float) -> bool ; qualifiers=virtual

Called each physics tick. `delta` is the logical time between physics ticks in seconds and is equal to `Engine.time_scale` / `Engine.physics_ticks_per_second`. Equivalent to `Node._physics_process`.
If implemented, the method must return a boolean value. `true` ends the main loop, while `false` lets it proceed to the next step.
**Note:** `_physics_process` may be called up to `Engine.max_physics_steps_per_frame` times per (idle) frame. This step limit may be reached when the engine is suffering performance issues.
**Note:** Accumulated `delta` may diverge from real world seconds.

> method _process(delta: float) -> bool ; qualifiers=virtual

Called on each idle frame, prior to rendering, and after physics ticks have been processed. `delta` is the time between frames in seconds. Equivalent to `Node._process`.
If implemented, the method must return a boolean value. `true` ends the main loop, while `false` lets it proceed to the next frame.
**Note:** When the engine is struggling and the frame rate is lowered, `delta` will increase. When `delta` is increased, it's capped at a maximum of `Engine.time_scale` * `Engine.max_physics_steps_per_frame` / `Engine.physics_ticks_per_second`. As a result, accumulated `delta` may not represent real world time.
**Note:** When `--fixed-fps` is enabled or the engine is running in Movie Maker mode (see `MovieWriter`), process `delta` will always be the same for every frame, regardless of how much time the frame took to render.
**Note:** Frame delta may be post-processed by `OS.delta_smoothing` if this is enabled for the project.

## Signals

> signal on_request_permissions_result(permission: String, granted: bool)

Emitted when a user responds to a permission request.

## Constants

> constant NOTIFICATION_OS_MEMORY_WARNING = 2009

Notification received from the OS when the application is exceeding its allocated memory.
Specific to the iOS platform.

> constant NOTIFICATION_TRANSLATION_CHANGED = 2010

Notification received when translations may have changed. Can be triggered by the user changing the locale. Can be used to respond to language changes, for example to change the UI strings on the fly. Useful when working with the built-in translation support, like `Object.tr`.

> constant NOTIFICATION_WM_ABOUT = 2011

Notification received from the OS when a request for "About" information is sent.
Specific to the macOS platform.

> constant NOTIFICATION_CRASH = 2012

Notification received from Godot's crash handler when the engine is about to crash.
Implemented on desktop platforms if the crash handler is enabled.

> constant NOTIFICATION_OS_IME_UPDATE = 2013

Notification received from the OS when an update of the Input Method Engine occurs (e.g. change of IME cursor position or composition string).
Implemented on desktop and web platforms.

> constant NOTIFICATION_APPLICATION_RESUMED = 2014

Notification received from the OS when the application is resumed.
Specific to the Android and iOS platforms.

> constant NOTIFICATION_APPLICATION_PAUSED = 2015

Notification received from the OS when the application is paused.
Specific to the Android and iOS platforms.
**Note:** On iOS, you only have approximately 5 seconds to finish a task started by this signal. If you go over this allotment, iOS will kill the app instead of pausing it.

> constant NOTIFICATION_APPLICATION_FOCUS_IN = 2016

Notification received from the OS when the application is focused, i.e. when changing the focus from the OS desktop or a thirdparty application to any open window of the Godot instance.
Implemented on desktop and mobile platforms.

> constant NOTIFICATION_APPLICATION_FOCUS_OUT = 2017

Notification received from the OS when the application is defocused, i.e. when changing the focus from any open window of the Godot instance to the OS desktop or a thirdparty application.
Implemented on desktop and mobile platforms.

> constant NOTIFICATION_TEXT_SERVER_CHANGED = 2018

Notification received when text server is changed.

> constant NOTIFICATION_APPLICATION_PIP_MODE_ENTERED = 2019

Notification received when the application enters picture-in-picture mode.

> constant NOTIFICATION_APPLICATION_PIP_MODE_EXITED = 2020

Notification received when the application exits picture-in-picture mode.
