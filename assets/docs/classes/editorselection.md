# EditorSelection

> class EditorSelection
> inherits EditorSelection Object

## Brief

Manages the SceneTree selection in the editor.

## Description

This object manages the SceneTree selection in the editor.
**Note:** This class shouldn't be instantiated directly. Instead, access the singleton using `EditorInterface.get_selection`.

## Methods

> method add_node(node: Node) -> void

Adds a node to the selection.
**Note:** The newly selected node will not be automatically edited in the inspector. If you want to edit a node, use `EditorInterface.edit_node`.

> method clear() -> void

Clear the selection.

> method get_selected_nodes() -> Array[Node]

Returns the list of selected nodes.

> method get_top_selected_nodes() -> Array[Node]

Returns the list of top selected nodes only, excluding any children. This is useful for performing transform operations (moving them, rotating, etc.).
For example, if there is a node A with a child B and a sibling C, then selecting all three will cause this method to return only A and C. Changing the global transform of A will affect the global transform of B, so there is no need to change B separately.

> method get_transformable_selected_nodes() -> Array[Node] ; deprecated=Use `get_top_selected_nodes` instead.

Returns the list of top selected nodes only, excluding any children. This is useful for performing transform operations (moving them, rotating, etc.). See `get_top_selected_nodes`.

> method remove_node(node: Node) -> void

Removes a node from the selection.

## Signals

> signal selection_changed()

Emitted when the selection changes.
