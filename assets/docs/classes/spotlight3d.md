# SpotLight3D

> class SpotLight3D

## Brief

A spotlight, such as a reflector spotlight or a lantern.

## Description

A Spotlight is a type of `Light3D` node that emits lights in a specific direction, in the shape of a cone. The light is attenuated through the distance. This attenuation can be configured by changing the energy, radius and attenuation parameters of `Light3D`.
Light is emitted in the -Z direction of the node's global basis. For an unrotated light, this means that the light is emitted forwards, illuminating the front side of a 3D model (see `Vector3.FORWARD` and `Vector3.MODEL_FRONT`).
**Note:** When using the Mobile rendering method, only 8 spot lights can be displayed on each mesh resource. Attempting to display more than 8 spot lights on a single mesh resource will result in spot lights flickering in and out as the camera moves. When using the Compatibility rendering method, only 8 spot lights can be displayed on each mesh resource by default, but this can be increased by adjusting `ProjectSettings.rendering/limits/opengl/max_lights_per_object`.
**Note:** When using the Mobile or Compatibility rendering methods, spot lights will only correctly affect meshes whose visibility AABB intersects with the light's AABB. If using a shader to deform the mesh in a way that makes it go outside its AABB, `GeometryInstance3D.extra_cull_margin` must be increased on the mesh. Otherwise, the light may not be visible on the mesh.

## Properties

> property light_specular : float ; default=0.5 ; setter=set_param ; getter=get_param ; overrides=Light3D

> property shadow_bias : float ; default=0.03 ; setter=set_param ; getter=get_param ; overrides=Light3D

> property shadow_normal_bias : float ; default=1.0 ; setter=set_param ; getter=get_param ; overrides=Light3D

> property spot_angle : float ; default=45.0 ; setter=set_param ; getter=get_param

The spotlight's angle in degrees. This is the angular radius, meaning the angle from the -Z axis, the cone's center, to the edge of the cone. The default angular radius of 45 degrees corresponds to a cone with an angular diameter of 90 degrees.
**Note:** `spot_angle` is not affected by `Node3D.scale` (the light's scale or its parent's scale).

> property spot_angle_attenuation : float ; default=1.0 ; setter=set_param ; getter=get_param

The spotlight's *angular* attenuation curve. See also `spot_attenuation`.

> property spot_attenuation : float ; default=1.0 ; setter=set_param ; getter=get_param

Controls the distance attenuation function for spotlights.
A value of `0.0` will maintain a constant brightness through most of the range, but smoothly attenuate the light at the edge of the range. Use a value of `2.0` for physically accurate lights as it results in the proper inverse square attenutation.
**Note:** Setting attenuation to `2.0` or higher may result in distant objects receiving minimal light, even within range. For example, with a range of `4096`, an object at `100` units is attenuated by a factor of `0.0001`. With a default brightness of `1`, the light would not be visible at that distance.
**Note:** Using negative or values higher than `10.0` may lead to unexpected results.

> property spot_range : float ; default=5.0 ; setter=set_param ; getter=get_param

The maximal range that can be reached by the spotlight. Note that the effectively lit area may appear to be smaller depending on the `spot_attenuation` in use. No matter the `spot_attenuation` in use, the light will never reach anything outside this range.
**Note:** `spot_range` is not affected by `Node3D.scale` (the light's scale or its parent's scale).
