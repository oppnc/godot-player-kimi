# VisualInstance3D

> class VisualInstance3D
> inherits VisualInstance3D Node3D

## Brief

Parent of all visual 3D nodes.

## Description

The `VisualInstance3D` is used to connect a resource to a visual representation. All visual 3D nodes inherit from the `VisualInstance3D`. In general, you should not access the `VisualInstance3D` properties directly as they are accessed and managed by the nodes that inherit from `VisualInstance3D`. `VisualInstance3D` is the node representation of the `RenderingServer` instance.

## Properties

> property layers : int ; default=1 ; setter=set_layer_mask ; getter=get_layer_mask

The render layer(s) this `VisualInstance3D` is drawn on.
This object will only be visible for `Camera3D`s whose cull mask includes any of the render layers this `VisualInstance3D` is set to.
For `Light3D`s, this can be used to control which `VisualInstance3D`s are affected by a specific light. For `GPUParticles3D`, this can be used to control which particles are effected by a specific attractor. For `Decal`s, this can be used to control which `VisualInstance3D`s are affected by a specific decal.
To adjust `layers` more easily using a script, use `get_layer_mask_value` and `set_layer_mask_value`.
**Note:** `VoxelGI`, SDFGI and `LightmapGI` will always take all layers into account to determine what contributes to global illumination. If this is an issue, set `GeometryInstance3D.gi_mode` to `GeometryInstance3D.GI_MODE_DISABLED` for meshes and `Light3D.light_bake_mode` to `Light3D.BAKE_DISABLED` for lights to exclude them from global illumination.

> property sorting_offset : float ; default=0.0 ; setter=set_sorting_offset ; getter=get_sorting_offset

The amount by which the depth of this `VisualInstance3D` will be adjusted when sorting by depth. Uses the same units as the engine (which are typically meters). Adjusting it to a higher value will make the `VisualInstance3D` reliably draw on top of other `VisualInstance3D`s that are otherwise positioned at the same spot. To ensure it always draws on top of other objects around it (not positioned at the same spot), set the value to be greater than the distance between this `VisualInstance3D` and the other nearby `VisualInstance3D`s.

> property sorting_use_aabb_center : bool ; setter=set_sorting_use_aabb_center ; getter=is_sorting_use_aabb_center

If `true`, the object is sorted based on the `AABB` center. The object will be sorted based on the global position otherwise.
The `AABB` center based sorting is generally more accurate for 3D models. The position based sorting instead allows to better control the drawing order when working with `GPUParticles3D` and `CPUParticles3D`.

## Methods

> method _get_aabb() -> AABB ; qualifiers=virtual const

> method get_aabb() -> AABB ; qualifiers=const

Returns the `AABB` (also known as the bounding box) for this `VisualInstance3D`.

> method get_base() -> RID ; qualifiers=const

Returns the RID of the resource associated with this `VisualInstance3D`. For example, if the Node is a `MeshInstance3D`, this will return the RID of the associated `Mesh`.

> method get_instance() -> RID ; qualifiers=const

Returns the RID of this instance. This RID is the same as the RID returned by `RenderingServer.instance_create`. This RID is needed if you want to call `RenderingServer` functions directly on this `VisualInstance3D`.

> method get_layer_mask_value(layer_number: int) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns whether or not the specified layer of the `layers` is enabled, given a `layer_number` between 1 and 20.

> method set_base(base: RID) -> void

Sets the resource that is instantiated by this `VisualInstance3D`, which changes how the engine handles the `VisualInstance3D` under the hood. Equivalent to `RenderingServer.instance_set_base`.

> method set_layer_mask_value(layer_number: int, value: bool) -> void

Based on `value`, enables or disables the specified layer in the `layers`, given a `layer_number` between 1 and 20.
