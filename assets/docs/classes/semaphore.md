# Semaphore

> class Semaphore
> inherits Semaphore RefCounted

## Brief

A synchronization mechanism used to control access to a shared resource by `Thread`s.

## Description

A synchronization semaphore that can be used to synchronize multiple `Thread`s. Initialized to zero on creation. For a binary version, see `Mutex`.
**Warning:** Semaphores must be used carefully to avoid deadlocks.
**Warning:** To guarantee that the operating system is able to perform proper cleanup (no crashes, no deadlocks), these conditions must be met:
- When a `Semaphore`'s reference count reaches zero and it is therefore destroyed, no threads must be waiting on it.
- When a `Thread`'s reference count reaches zero and it is therefore destroyed, it must not be waiting on any semaphore.

## Methods

> method post(count: int = 1) -> void

Lowers the `Semaphore`, allowing one thread in, or more if `count` is specified.

> method try_wait() -> bool

Like `wait`, but won't block, so if the value is zero, fails immediately and returns `false`. If non-zero, it returns `true` to report success.

> method wait() -> void

Waits for the `Semaphore`, if its value is zero, blocks until non-zero.
