# AnimationNodeBlendSpace2D

> class AnimationNodeBlendSpace2D
> inherits AnimationNodeBlendSpace2D AnimationRootNode

## Brief

A set of `AnimationRootNode`s placed on 2D coordinates, crossfading between the three adjacent ones. Used by `AnimationTree`.

## Description

A resource used by `AnimationNodeBlendTree`.
`AnimationNodeBlendSpace2D` represents a virtual 2D space on which `AnimationRootNode`s are placed. Outputs the linear blend of the three adjacent animations using a `Vector2` weight. Adjacent in this context means the three `AnimationRootNode`s making up the triangle that contains the current value.
You can add vertices to the blend space with `add_blend_point` and automatically triangulate it by setting `auto_triangles` to `true`. Otherwise, use `add_triangle` and `remove_triangle` to triangulate the blend space by hand.

## Properties

> property auto_triangles : bool ; default=true ; setter=set_auto_triangles ; getter=get_auto_triangles

If `true`, the blend space is triangulated automatically. The mesh updates every time you add or remove points with `add_blend_point` and `remove_blend_point`.

> property blend_mode : BlendMode ; default=0 ; setter=set_blend_mode ; getter=get_blend_mode

Controls the interpolation between animations.

> property cyclic_length : float ; default=0.0 ; setter=set_cyclic_length ; getter=get_cyclic_length

The cycle length in seconds used by `SYNC_MODE_CYCLIC_CONSTANT`. All animations are time-scaled so they complete one full cycle in this duration. Must be greater than `0` for cyclic sync to take effect.

> property max_space : Vector2 ; default=Vector2(1, 1) ; setter=set_max_space ; getter=get_max_space

The blend space's X and Y axes' upper limit for the points' position. See `add_blend_point`.

> property min_space : Vector2 ; default=Vector2(-1, -1) ; setter=set_min_space ; getter=get_min_space

The blend space's X and Y axes' lower limit for the points' position. See `add_blend_point`.

> property snap : Vector2 ; default=Vector2(0.1, 0.1) ; setter=set_snap ; getter=get_snap

Position increment to snap to when moving a point.

> property sync : bool ; setter=set_use_sync ; getter=is_using_sync ; deprecated=Use `sync_mode` instead.

If `true`, sync mode is enabled (equivalent to `SYNC_MODE_INDEPENDENT`). This property is kept for backward compatibility.

> property sync_mode : SyncMode ; default=0 ; setter=set_sync_mode ; getter=get_sync_mode

Controls how animations are synced when blended. See `SyncMode` for available options.

> property x_label : String ; default="x" ; setter=set_x_label ; getter=get_x_label

Name of the blend space's X axis.

> property y_label : String ; default="y" ; setter=set_y_label ; getter=get_y_label

Name of the blend space's Y axis.

## Methods

> method add_blend_point(node: AnimationRootNode, pos: Vector2, at_index: int = -1, name: StringName = &"") -> void

Adds a new point with `name` that represents a `node` at the position set by `pos`. You can insert it at a specific index using the `at_index` argument. If you use the default value for `at_index`, the point is inserted at the end of the blend points array.
**Note:** If no name is provided, safe index is used as reference. In the future, empty names will be deprecated, so explicitly passing a name is recommended.

> method add_triangle(x: int, y: int, z: int, at_index: int = -1) -> void

Creates a new triangle using three points `x`, `y`, and `z`. Triangles can overlap. You can insert the triangle at a specific index using the `at_index` argument. If you use the default value for `at_index`, the point is inserted at the end of the blend points array.

> method find_blend_point_by_name(name: StringName) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the index of the blend point with the given `name`. Returns `-1` if no blend point with that name is found.

> method get_blend_point_count() -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the number of points in the blend space.

> method get_blend_point_name(point: int) -> StringName ; qualifiers=const

Returns the name of the blend point at index `point`.

> method get_blend_point_node(point: int) -> AnimationRootNode ; qualifiers=const

Returns the `AnimationRootNode` referenced by the point at index `point`.

> method get_blend_point_position(point: int) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the position of the point at index `point`.

> method get_triangle_count() -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the number of triangles in the blend space.

> method get_triangle_point(triangle: int, point: int) -> int

Returns the position of the point at index `point` in the triangle of index `triangle`.

> method remove_blend_point(point: int) -> void

Removes the point at index `point` from the blend space.

> method remove_triangle(triangle: int) -> void

Removes the triangle at index `triangle` from the blend space.

> method reorder_blend_point(from_index: int, to_index: int) -> void

Swaps the blend points at indices `from_index` and `to_index`, exchanging their positions and properties.

> method set_blend_point_name(point: int, name: StringName) -> void

Sets the name of the blend point at index `point`. If the name conflicts with an existing point, a unique name will be generated automatically.

> method set_blend_point_node(point: int, node: AnimationRootNode) -> void

Changes the `AnimationNode` referenced by the point at index `point`.

> method set_blend_point_position(point: int, pos: Vector2) -> void

Updates the position of the point at index `point` in the blend space.

## Signals

> signal triangles_updated()

Emitted every time the blend space's triangles are created, removed, or when one of their vertices changes position.

## Enumerations

> enum BlendMode

> enum_value BlendMode.BLEND_MODE_INTERPOLATED = 0

The interpolation between animations is linear.

> enum_value BlendMode.BLEND_MODE_DISCRETE = 1

The blend space plays the animation of the animation node which blending position is closest to. Useful for frame-by-frame 2D animations.

> enum_value BlendMode.BLEND_MODE_DISCRETE_CARRY = 2

Similar to `BLEND_MODE_DISCRETE`, but starts the new animation at the last animation's playback position.

> enum SyncMode

> enum_value SyncMode.SYNC_MODE_NONE = 0

Inactive animations are frozen and do not advance.

> enum_value SyncMode.SYNC_MODE_INDEPENDENT = 1

Inactive animations advance with a weight of `0`. This is equivalent to the previous `sync = true` behavior.

> enum_value SyncMode.SYNC_MODE_CYCLIC_MUTABLE = 2

All animations are time-scaled so they stay in sync, with the cycle length dynamically computed from active blend weights. This is self-normalizing: a solo animation plays at normal speed.
**Note:** If you apply `AnimationNodeTimeSeek` to the result when handling animations of different lengths, synchronization will be broken. In such cases, it is recommended to use `AnimationNodeAnimation.use_custom_timeline` to align the animation lengths.

> enum_value SyncMode.SYNC_MODE_CYCLIC_CONSTANT = 3

All animations are time-scaled so they complete one cycle in `cyclic_length` seconds, keeping them in sync regardless of their individual lengths.
**Note:** If you apply `AnimationNodeTimeSeek` to the result when handling animations of different lengths, synchronization will be broken. In such cases, it is recommended to use `AnimationNodeAnimation.use_custom_timeline` to align the animation lengths.
