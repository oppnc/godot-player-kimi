# Transform3D

> class Transform3D

## Brief

A 3×4 matrix representing a 3D transformation.

## Description

The `Transform3D` built-in `Variant` type is a 3×4 matrix representing a transformation in 3D space. It contains a `Basis`, which on its own can represent rotation, scale, and shear. Additionally, combined with its own `origin`, the transform can also represent a translation.
For a general introduction, see the [Matrices and transforms]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/math/matrices_and_transforms.html) tutorial.
**Note:** Godot uses a [right-handed coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule), which is a common standard. For directions, the convention for built-in types like `Camera3D` is for -Z to point forward (+X is right, +Y is up, and +Z is back). Other objects may use different direction conventions. For more information, see the [3D asset direction conventions]($DOCS_URL/tutorials/assets_pipeline/importing_3d_scenes/model_export_considerations.html#d-asset-direction-conventions) tutorial.
**Note:** In a boolean context, a Transform3D will evaluate to `false` if it's equal to `IDENTITY`. Otherwise, a Transform3D will always evaluate to `true`.

## Properties

> property basis : Basis ; default=Basis(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1)

The `Basis` of this transform. It is composed by 3 axes (`Basis.x`, `Basis.y`, and `Basis.z`). Together, these represent the transform's rotation, scale, and shear.

> property origin : Vector3 ; default=Vector3(0, 0, 0)

The translation offset of this transform. In 3D space, this can be seen as the position.

## Constructors

> constructor Transform3D()

Constructs a `Transform3D` identical to `IDENTITY`.
**Note:** In C#, this constructs a `Transform3D` with its `origin` and the components of its `basis` set to `Vector3.ZERO`.

> constructor Transform3D(from: Transform3D)

Constructs a `Transform3D` as a copy of the given `Transform3D`.

> constructor Transform3D(basis: Basis, origin: Vector3)

Constructs a `Transform3D` from a `Basis` and `Vector3`.

> constructor Transform3D(from: Projection)

Constructs a `Transform3D` from a `Projection`. Because `Transform3D` is a 3×4 matrix and `Projection` is a 4×4 matrix, this operation trims the last row of the projection matrix (`from.x.w`, `from.y.w`, `from.z.w`, and `from.w.w` are not included in the new transform).

> constructor Transform3D(x_axis: Vector3, y_axis: Vector3, z_axis: Vector3, origin: Vector3)

Constructs a `Transform3D` from four `Vector3` values (also called matrix columns).
The first three arguments are the `basis`'s axes (`Basis.x`, `Basis.y`, and `Basis.z`).

## Methods

> method affine_inverse() -> Transform3D ; qualifiers=const

Returns the inverted version of this transform. Unlike `inverse`, this method works with almost any `basis`, including non-uniform ones, but is slower. See also `Basis.inverse`.
**Note:** For this method to return correctly, the transform's `basis` needs to have a determinant that is not exactly `0.0` (see `Basis.determinant`).

> method interpolate_with(xform: Transform3D, weight: float) -> Transform3D ; qualifiers=const

Returns the result of the linear interpolation between this transform and `xform` by the given `weight`.
The `weight` should be between `0.0` and `1.0` (inclusive). Values outside this range are allowed and can be used to perform *extrapolation* instead.

> method inverse() -> Transform3D ; qualifiers=const

Returns the [inverted version of this transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix). See also `Basis.inverse`.
**Note:** For this method to return correctly, the transform's `basis` needs to be *orthonormal* (see `orthonormalized`). That means the basis should only represent a rotation. If it does not, use `affine_inverse` instead.

> method is_equal_approx(xform: Transform3D) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this transform and `xform` are approximately equal, by running `@GlobalScope.is_equal_approx` on each component.

> method is_finite() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if this transform is finite, by calling `@GlobalScope.is_finite` on each component.

> method looking_at(target: Vector3, up: Vector3 = Vector3(0, 1, 0), use_model_front: bool = false) -> Transform3D ; qualifiers=const

Returns a copy of this transform rotated so that the forward axis (-Z) points towards the `target` position.
The up axis (+Y) points as close to the `up` vector as possible while staying perpendicular to the forward axis. The resulting transform is orthonormalized. The existing rotation, scale, and skew information from the original transform is discarded. The `target` and `up` vectors cannot be zero, cannot be parallel to each other, and are defined in global/parent space.
If `use_model_front` is `true`, the +Z axis (asset front) is treated as forward (implies +X is left) and points toward the `target` position. By default, the -Z axis (camera forward) is treated as forward (implies +X is right).

> method orthonormalized() -> Transform3D ; qualifiers=const

Returns a copy of this transform with its `basis` orthonormalized. An orthonormal basis is both *orthogonal* (the axes are perpendicular to each other) and *normalized* (the axes have a length of `1.0`), which also means it can only represent a rotation. See also `Basis.orthonormalized`.

> method rotated(axis: Vector3, angle: float) -> Transform3D ; qualifiers=const

Returns a copy of this transform rotated around the given `axis` by the given `angle` (in radians).
The `axis` must be a normalized vector (see `Vector3.normalized`). If `angle` is positive, the basis is rotated counter-clockwise around the axis.
This method is an optimized version of multiplying the given transform `X` with a corresponding rotation transform `R` from the left, i.e., `R * X`.
This can be seen as transforming with respect to the global/parent frame.

> method rotated_local(axis: Vector3, angle: float) -> Transform3D ; qualifiers=const

Returns a copy of this transform rotated around the given `axis` by the given `angle` (in radians).
The `axis` must be a normalized vector in the transform's local coordinate system. For example, to rotate around the local X-axis, use `Vector3.RIGHT`.
This method is an optimized version of multiplying the given transform `X` with a corresponding rotation transform `R` from the right, i.e., `X * R`.
This can be seen as transforming with respect to the local frame.

> method scaled(scale: Vector3) -> Transform3D ; qualifiers=const

Returns a copy of this transform scaled by the given `scale` factor.
This method is an optimized version of multiplying the given transform `X` with a corresponding scaling transform `S` from the left, i.e., `S * X`.
This can be seen as transforming with respect to the global/parent frame.

> method scaled_local(scale: Vector3) -> Transform3D ; qualifiers=const

Returns a copy of this transform scaled by the given `scale` factor.
This method is an optimized version of multiplying the given transform `X` with a corresponding scaling transform `S` from the right, i.e., `X * S`.
This can be seen as transforming with respect to the local frame.

> method translated(offset: Vector3) -> Transform3D ; qualifiers=const

Returns a copy of this transform translated by the given `offset`.
This method is an optimized version of multiplying the given transform `X` with a corresponding translation transform `T` from the left, i.e., `T * X`.
This can be seen as transforming with respect to the global/parent frame.

> method translated_local(offset: Vector3) -> Transform3D ; qualifiers=const

Returns a copy of this transform translated by the given `offset`.
This method is an optimized version of multiplying the given transform `X` with a corresponding translation transform `T` from the right, i.e., `X * T`.
This can be seen as transforming with respect to the local frame.

## Operators

> operator !=(right: Transform3D) -> bool

Returns `true` if the components of both transforms are not equal.
**Note:** Due to floating-point precision errors, consider using `is_equal_approx` instead, which is more reliable.

> operator *(right: AABB) -> AABB

Transforms (multiplies) the `AABB` by this transformation matrix.

> operator *(right: PackedVector3Array) -> PackedVector3Array

Transforms (multiplies) every `Vector3` element of the given `PackedVector3Array` by this transformation matrix.
On larger arrays, this operation is much faster than transforming each `Vector3` individually.

> operator *(right: Plane) -> Plane

Transforms (multiplies) the `Plane` by this transformation matrix.

> operator *(right: Transform3D) -> Transform3D

Transforms (multiplies) this transform by the `right` transform.
This is the operation performed between parent and child `Node3D`s.
**Note:** If you need to only modify one attribute of this transform, consider using one of the following methods, instead:
- For translation, see `translated` or `translated_local`.
- For rotation, see `rotated` or `rotated_local`.
- For scale, see `scaled` or `scaled_local`.

> operator *(right: Vector3) -> Vector3

Transforms (multiplies) the `Vector3` by this transformation matrix.

> operator *(right: float) -> Transform3D

Multiplies all components of the `Transform3D` by the given `float`, including the `origin`. This affects the transform's scale uniformly, scaling the `basis`.

> operator *(right: int) -> Transform3D

Multiplies all components of the `Transform3D` by the given `int`, including the `origin`. This affects the transform's scale uniformly, scaling the `basis`.

> operator /(right: float) -> Transform3D

Divides all components of the `Transform3D` by the given `float`, including the `origin`. This affects the transform's scale uniformly, scaling the `basis`.

> operator /(right: int) -> Transform3D

Divides all components of the `Transform3D` by the given `int`, including the `origin`. This affects the transform's scale uniformly, scaling the `basis`.

> operator ==(right: Transform3D) -> bool

Returns `true` if the components of both transforms are exactly equal.
**Note:** Due to floating-point precision errors, consider using `is_equal_approx` instead, which is more reliable.

## Constants

> constant IDENTITY = Transform3D(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0)

The identity `Transform3D`. This is a transform with no translation, no rotation, and a scale of `Vector3.ONE`. Its `basis` is equal to `Basis.IDENTITY`. This also means that:
- Its `Basis.x` points right (`Vector3.RIGHT`);
- Its `Basis.y` points up (`Vector3.UP`);
- Its `Basis.z` points back (`Vector3.BACK`).

```text
            var transform = Transform3D.IDENTITY
            var basis = transform.basis
            print("| X | Y | Z | Origin")
            print("| %.f | %.f | %.f | %.f" % [basis.x.x, basis.y.x, basis.z.x, transform.origin.x])
            print("| %.f | %.f | %.f | %.f" % [basis.x.y, basis.y.y, basis.z.y, transform.origin.y])
            print("| %.f | %.f | %.f | %.f" % [basis.x.z, basis.y.z, basis.z.z, transform.origin.z])
            # Prints:
            # | X | Y | Z | Origin
            # | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0
            # | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0
            # | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0

```

If a `Vector3`, an `AABB`, a `Plane`, a `PackedVector3Array`, or another `Transform3D` is transformed (multiplied) by this constant, no transformation occurs.
**Note:** In GDScript, this constant is equivalent to creating a `Transform3D` without any arguments. It can be used to make your code clearer, and for consistency with C#.

> constant FLIP_X = Transform3D(-1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0)

`Transform3D` with mirroring applied perpendicular to the YZ plane. Its `basis` is equal to `Basis.FLIP_X`.

> constant FLIP_Y = Transform3D(1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0)

`Transform3D` with mirroring applied perpendicular to the XZ plane. Its `basis` is equal to `Basis.FLIP_Y`.

> constant FLIP_Z = Transform3D(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0)

`Transform3D` with mirroring applied perpendicular to the XY plane. Its `basis` is equal to `Basis.FLIP_Z`.
