# AudioEffectInstance

> class AudioEffectInstance
> inherits AudioEffectInstance RefCounted

## Brief

Manipulates the audio it receives for a given effect.

## Description

An audio effect instance manipulates the audio it receives for a given effect. This instance is automatically created by an `AudioEffect` when it is added to a bus, and should usually not be created directly. If necessary, it can be fetched at run-time with `AudioServer.get_bus_effect_instance`.

## Methods

> method _process(src_buffer: const void*, r_dst_buffer: AudioFrame*, frame_count: int) -> void ; qualifiers=virtual required

Called by the `AudioServer` to process this effect. When `_process_silence` is not overridden or it returns `false`, this method is called only when the bus is active.
**Note:** It is not useful to override this method in GDScript or C#. Only GDExtension can take advantage of it.

> method _process_silence() -> bool ; qualifiers=virtual const

Override this method to customize the processing behavior of this effect instance.
Should return `true` to force the `AudioServer` to always call `_process`, even if the bus has been muted or cannot otherwise be heard.
