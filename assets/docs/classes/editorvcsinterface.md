# EditorVCSInterface

> class EditorVCSInterface
> inherits EditorVCSInterface Object

## Brief

Version Control System (VCS) interface, which reads and writes to the local VCS in use.

## Description

Defines the API that the editor uses to extract information from the underlying VCS. The implementation of this API is included in VCS plugins, which are GDExtension plugins that inherit `EditorVCSInterface` and are attached (on demand) to the singleton instance of `EditorVCSInterface`. Instead of performing the task themselves, all the virtual functions listed below are calling the internally overridden functions in the VCS plugins to provide a plug-n-play experience. A custom VCS plugin is supposed to inherit from `EditorVCSInterface` and override each of these virtual functions.

## Methods

> method _allow_amends() -> bool ; qualifiers=virtual

Returns whether or not the plugin allows commit amends.

> method _checkout_branch(branch_name: String) -> bool ; qualifiers=virtual required

Checks out a `branch_name` in the VCS.

> method _commit(msg: String, amend: bool) -> void ; qualifiers=virtual

Commits the currently staged changes and applies the commit `msg` to the resulting commit. If `amend` is `true` the commit will modify the most recent commit instead.

> method _create_branch(branch_name: String) -> void ; qualifiers=virtual required

Creates a new branch named `branch_name` in the VCS.

> method _create_remote(remote_name: String, remote_url: String) -> void ; qualifiers=virtual required

Creates a new remote destination with name `remote_name` and points it to `remote_url`. This can be an HTTPS remote or an SSH remote.

> method _discard_file(file_path: String) -> void ; qualifiers=virtual required

Discards the changes made in a file present at `file_path`.

> method _fetch(remote: String) -> void ; qualifiers=virtual required

Fetches new changes from the `remote`, but doesn't write changes to the current working directory. Equivalent to `git fetch`.

> method _get_branch_list() -> Array[String] ; qualifiers=virtual required

Gets an instance of an `Array` of `String`s containing available branch names in the VCS.

> method _get_current_branch_name() -> String ; qualifiers=virtual required

Gets the current branch name defined in the VCS.

> method _get_diff(identifier: String, area: int) -> Array[Dictionary] ; qualifiers=virtual required

Returns an array of `Dictionary` items (see `create_diff_file`, `create_diff_hunk`, `create_diff_line`, `add_line_diffs_into_diff_hunk` and `add_diff_hunks_into_diff_file`), each containing information about a diff. If `identifier` is a file path, returns a file diff, and if it is a commit identifier, then returns a commit diff.

> method _get_line_diff(file_path: String, text: String) -> Array[Dictionary] ; qualifiers=virtual required

Returns an `Array` of `Dictionary` items (see `create_diff_hunk`), each containing a line diff between a file at `file_path` and the `text` which is passed in.

> method _get_modified_files_data() -> Array[Dictionary] ; qualifiers=virtual required

Returns an `Array` of `Dictionary` items (see `create_status_file`), each containing the status data of every modified file in the project folder.

> method _get_previous_commits(max_commits: int) -> Array[Dictionary] ; qualifiers=virtual required

Returns an `Array` of `Dictionary` items (see `create_commit`), each containing the data for a past commit.

> method _get_remotes() -> Array[String] ; qualifiers=virtual required

Returns an `Array` of `String`s, each containing the name of a remote configured in the VCS.

> method _get_vcs_name() -> String ; qualifiers=virtual required

Returns the name of the underlying VCS provider.

> method _initialize(project_path: String) -> bool ; qualifiers=virtual required

Initializes the VCS plugin when called from the editor. Returns whether or not the plugin was successfully initialized. A VCS project is initialized at `project_path`.

> method _pull(remote: String) -> void ; qualifiers=virtual required

Pulls changes from the remote. This can give rise to merge conflicts.

> method _push(remote: String, force: bool) -> void ; qualifiers=virtual required

Pushes changes to the `remote`. If `force` is `true`, a force push will override the change history already present on the remote.

> method _remove_branch(branch_name: String) -> void ; qualifiers=virtual required

Remove a branch from the local VCS.

> method _remove_remote(remote_name: String) -> void ; qualifiers=virtual required

Remove a remote from the local VCS.

> method _set_credentials(username: String, password: String, ssh_public_key_path: String, ssh_private_key_path: String, ssh_passphrase: String) -> void ; qualifiers=virtual required

Set user credentials in the underlying VCS. `username` and `password` are used only during HTTPS authentication unless not already mentioned in the remote URL. `ssh_public_key_path`, `ssh_private_key_path`, and `ssh_passphrase` are only used during SSH authentication.

> method _shut_down() -> bool ; qualifiers=virtual required

Shuts down VCS plugin instance. Called when the user either closes the editor or shuts down the VCS plugin through the editor UI.

> method _stage_file(file_path: String) -> void ; qualifiers=virtual required

Stages the file present at `file_path` to the staged area.

> method _unstage_file(file_path: String) -> void ; qualifiers=virtual required

Unstages the file present at `file_path` from the staged area to the unstaged area.

> method add_diff_hunks_into_diff_file(diff_file: Dictionary, diff_hunks: Array[Dictionary]) -> Dictionary

Helper function to add an array of `diff_hunks` into a `diff_file`.

> method add_line_diffs_into_diff_hunk(diff_hunk: Dictionary, line_diffs: Array[Dictionary]) -> Dictionary

Helper function to add an array of `line_diffs` into a `diff_hunk`.

> method create_commit(msg: String, author: String, id: String, unix_timestamp: int, offset_minutes: int) -> Dictionary

Helper function to create a commit `Dictionary` item. `msg` is the commit message of the commit. `author` is a single human-readable string containing all the author's details, e.g. the email and name configured in the VCS. `id` is the identifier of the commit, in whichever format your VCS may provide an identifier to commits. `unix_timestamp` is the UTC Unix timestamp of when the commit was created. `offset_minutes` is the timezone offset in minutes, recorded from the system timezone where the commit was created.

> method create_diff_file(new_file: String, old_file: String) -> Dictionary

Helper function to create a `Dictionary` for storing old and new diff file paths.

> method create_diff_hunk(old_start: int, new_start: int, old_lines: int, new_lines: int) -> Dictionary

Helper function to create a `Dictionary` for storing diff hunk data. `old_start` is the starting line number in old file. `new_start` is the starting line number in new file. `old_lines` is the number of lines in the old file. `new_lines` is the number of lines in the new file.

> method create_diff_line(new_line_no: int, old_line_no: int, content: String, status: String) -> Dictionary

Helper function to create a `Dictionary` for storing a line diff. `new_line_no` is the line number in the new file (can be `-1` if the line is deleted). `old_line_no` is the line number in the old file (can be `-1` if the line is added). `content` is the diff text. `status` is a single character string which stores the line origin.

> method create_status_file(file_path: String, change_type: ChangeType, area: TreeArea) -> Dictionary

Helper function to create a `Dictionary` used by editor to read the status of a file.

> method popup_error(msg: String) -> void

Pops up an error message in the editor which is shown as coming from the underlying VCS. Use this to show VCS specific error messages.
