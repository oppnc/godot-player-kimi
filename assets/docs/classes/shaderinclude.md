# ShaderInclude

> class ShaderInclude
> inherits ShaderInclude Resource

## Brief

A snippet of shader code to be included in a `Shader` with `#include`.

## Description

A shader include file, saved with the `.gdshaderinc` extension. This class allows you to define a custom shader snippet that can be included in a `Shader` by using the preprocessor directive `#include`, followed by the file path (e.g. `#include "res://shader_lib.gdshaderinc"`). The snippet doesn't have to be a valid shader on its own.

## Properties

> property code : String ; default="" ; setter=set_code ; getter=get_code

Returns the code of the shader include file. The returned text is what the user has written, not the full generated code used internally.
