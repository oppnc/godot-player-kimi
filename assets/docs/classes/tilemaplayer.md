# TileMapLayer

> class TileMapLayer
> inherits TileMapLayer Node2D

## Brief

Node for 2D tile-based maps.

## Description

Node for 2D tile-based maps. A `TileMapLayer` uses a `TileSet` which contain a list of tiles which are used to create grid-based maps. Unlike the `TileMap` node, which is deprecated, `TileMapLayer` has only one layer of tiles. You can use several `TileMapLayer` to achieve the same result as a `TileMap` node.
For performance reasons, all TileMap updates are batched at the end of a frame. Notably, this means that scene tiles from a `TileSetScenesCollectionSource` are initialized after their parent. This is only queued when inside the scene tree.
To force an update earlier on, call `update_internals`.
**Note:** For performance and compatibility reasons, the coordinates serialized by `TileMapLayer` are limited to 16-bit signed integers, i.e. the range for X and Y coordinates is from `-32768` to `32767`. When saving tile data, tiles outside this range are wrapped.

## Properties

> property collision_enabled : bool ; default=true ; setter=set_collision_enabled ; getter=is_collision_enabled

Enable or disable collisions.

> property collision_visibility_mode : DebugVisibilityMode ; default=0 ; setter=set_collision_visibility_mode ; getter=get_collision_visibility_mode

Show or hide the `TileMapLayer`'s collision shapes. If set to `DEBUG_VISIBILITY_MODE_DEFAULT`, this depends on the show collision debug settings.

> property enabled : bool ; default=true ; setter=set_enabled ; getter=is_enabled

If `false`, disables this `TileMapLayer` completely (rendering, collision, navigation, scene tiles, etc.)

> property navigation_enabled : bool ; default=true ; setter=set_navigation_enabled ; getter=is_navigation_enabled

If `true`, navigation regions are enabled.

> property navigation_visibility_mode : DebugVisibilityMode ; default=0 ; setter=set_navigation_visibility_mode ; getter=get_navigation_visibility_mode

Show or hide the `TileMapLayer`'s navigation meshes. If set to `DEBUG_VISIBILITY_MODE_DEFAULT`, this depends on the show navigation debug settings.

> property occlusion_enabled : bool ; default=true ; setter=set_occlusion_enabled ; getter=is_occlusion_enabled

Enable or disable light occlusion.

> property physics_quadrant_size : int ; default=16 ; setter=set_physics_quadrant_size ; getter=get_physics_quadrant_size

The `TileMapLayer`'s physics quadrant size. Within a physics quadrant, cells with similar physics properties are grouped together and their collision shapes get merged. `physics_quadrant_size` defines the length of a square's side, in the map's coordinate system, that forms the quadrant. Thus, the default quadrant size groups together `16 * 16 = 256` tiles.
**Note:** As quadrants are created according to the map's coordinate system, the quadrant's "square shape" might not look like square in the `TileMapLayer`'s local coordinate system.
**Note:** This impacts the value returned by `get_coords_for_body_rid`. Higher values will make that function less precise. To get the exact cell coordinates, you need to set `physics_quadrant_size` to `1`, which disables physics chunking.

> property rendering_quadrant_size : int ; default=16 ; setter=set_rendering_quadrant_size ; getter=get_rendering_quadrant_size

The `TileMapLayer`'s rendering quadrant size. A quadrant is a group of tiles to be drawn together on a single canvas item, for optimization purposes. `rendering_quadrant_size` defines the length of a square's side, in the map's coordinate system, that forms the quadrant. Thus, the default quadrant size groups together `16 * 16 = 256` tiles.
The quadrant size does not apply on a Y-sorted `TileMapLayer`, as tiles are grouped by Y position instead in that case.
**Note:** As quadrants are created according to the map's coordinate system, the quadrant's "square shape" might not look like square in the `TileMapLayer`'s local coordinate system.

> property tile_map_data : PackedByteArray ; default=PackedByteArray() ; setter=set_tile_map_data_from_array ; getter=get_tile_map_data_as_array

The raw tile map data as a byte array.

> property tile_set : TileSet ; setter=set_tile_set ; getter=get_tile_set

The `TileSet` used by this layer. The textures, collisions, and additional behavior of all available tiles are stored here.

> property use_kinematic_bodies : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_use_kinematic_bodies ; getter=is_using_kinematic_bodies

If `true`, this `TileMapLayer` collision shapes will be instantiated as kinematic bodies. This can be needed for moving `TileMapLayer` nodes (i.e. moving platforms).

> property x_draw_order_reversed : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_x_draw_order_reversed ; getter=is_x_draw_order_reversed

If `CanvasItem.y_sort_enabled` is enabled, setting this to `true` will reverse the order the tiles are drawn on the X-axis.

> property y_sort_origin : int ; default=0 ; setter=set_y_sort_origin ; getter=get_y_sort_origin

This Y-sort origin value is added to each tile's Y-sort origin value. This allows, for example, to fake a different height level. This can be useful for top-down view games.

## Methods

> method _tile_data_runtime_update(coords: Vector2i, tile_data: TileData) -> void ; qualifiers=virtual

Called with a `TileData` object about to be used internally by the `TileMapLayer`, allowing its modification at runtime.
This method is only called if `_use_tile_data_runtime_update` is implemented and returns `true` for the given tile `coords`.
**Warning:** The `tile_data` object's sub-resources are the same as the one in the TileSet. Modifying them might impact the whole TileSet. Instead, make sure to duplicate those resources.
**Note:** If the properties of `tile_data` object should change over time, use `notify_runtime_tile_data_update` to notify the `TileMapLayer` it needs an update.

> method _update_cells(coords: Array[Vector2i], forced_cleanup: bool) -> void ; qualifiers=virtual

Called when this `TileMapLayer`'s cells need an internal update. This update may be caused from individual cells being modified or by a change in the `tile_set` (causing all cells to be queued for an update). The first call to this function is always for initializing all the `TileMapLayer`'s cells. `coords` contains the coordinates of all modified cells, roughly in the order they were modified. `forced_cleanup` is `true` when the `TileMapLayer`'s internals should be fully cleaned up. This is the case when:
- The layer is disabled;
- The layer is not visible;
- `tile_set` is set to `null`;
- The node is removed from the tree;
- The node is freed.
Note that any internal update happening while one of these conditions is verified is considered to be a "cleanup". See also `update_internals`.
**Warning:** Implementing this method may degrade the `TileMapLayer`'s performance.

> method _use_tile_data_runtime_update(coords: Vector2i) -> bool ; qualifiers=virtual

Should return `true` if the tile at coordinates `coords` requires a runtime update.
**Warning:** Make sure this function only returns `true` when needed. Any tile processed at runtime without a need for it will imply a significant performance penalty.
**Note:** If the result of this function should change, use `notify_runtime_tile_data_update` to notify the `TileMapLayer` it needs an update.

> method clear() -> void

Clears all cells.

> method erase_cell(coords: Vector2i) -> void

Erases the cell at coordinates `coords`.

> method fix_invalid_tiles() -> void

Clears cells containing tiles that do not exist in the `tile_set`.

> method get_cell_alternative_tile(coords: Vector2i) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the tile alternative ID of the cell at coordinates `coords`.

> method get_cell_atlas_coords(coords: Vector2i) -> Vector2i ; qualifiers=const

Returns the tile atlas coordinates ID of the cell at coordinates `coords`. Returns `Vector2i(-1, -1)` if the cell does not exist.

> method get_cell_source_id(coords: Vector2i) -> int ; qualifiers=const

Returns the tile source ID of the cell at coordinates `coords`. Returns `-1` if the cell does not exist.

> method get_cell_tile_data(coords: Vector2i) -> TileData ; qualifiers=const

Returns the `TileData` object associated with the given cell, or `null` if the cell does not exist or is not a `TileSetAtlasSource`.

```text
                func get_clicked_tile_power():
                    var clicked_cell = tile_map_layer.local_to_map(tile_map_layer.get_local_mouse_position())
                    var data = tile_map_layer.get_cell_tile_data(clicked_cell)
                    if data:
                        return data.get_custom_data("power")
                    else:
                        return 0

```

> method get_coords_for_body_rid(body: RID) -> Vector2i ; qualifiers=const

Returns the coordinates of the physics quadrant (see `physics_quadrant_size`) for given physics body `RID`. Such an `RID` can be retrieved from `KinematicCollision2D.get_collider_rid`, when colliding with a tile.
**Note:** Higher values of `physics_quadrant_size` will make this function less precise. To get the exact cell coordinates, you need to set `physics_quadrant_size` to `1`, which disables physics chunking.

> method get_navigation_map() -> RID ; qualifiers=const

Returns the `RID` of the `NavigationServer2D` navigation used by this `TileMapLayer`.
By default this returns the default `World2D` navigation map, unless a custom map was provided using `set_navigation_map`.

> method get_neighbor_cell(coords: Vector2i, neighbor: TileSet.CellNeighbor) -> Vector2i ; qualifiers=const

Returns the neighboring cell to the one at coordinates `coords`, identified by the `neighbor` direction. This method takes into account the different layouts a TileMap can take.

> method get_pattern(coords_array: Array[Vector2i]) -> TileMapPattern

Creates and returns a new `TileMapPattern` from the given array of cells. See also `set_pattern`.

> method get_surrounding_cells(coords: Vector2i) -> Array[Vector2i]

Returns the list of all neighboring cells to the one at `coords`. Any neighboring cell is one that is touching edges, so for a square cell 4 cells would be returned, for a hexagon 6 cells are returned.

> method get_used_cells() -> Array[Vector2i] ; qualifiers=const

Returns a `Vector2i` array with the positions of all cells containing a tile. A cell is considered empty if its source identifier equals `-1`, its atlas coordinate identifier is `Vector2(-1, -1)` and its alternative identifier is `-1`.

> method get_used_cells_by_id(source_id: int = -1, atlas_coords: Vector2i = Vector2i(-1, -1), alternative_tile: int = -1) -> Array[Vector2i] ; qualifiers=const

Returns a `Vector2i` array with the positions of all cells containing a tile. Tiles may be filtered according to their source (`source_id`), their atlas coordinates (`atlas_coords`), or alternative id (`alternative_tile`).
If a parameter has its value set to the default one, this parameter is not used to filter a cell. Thus, if all parameters have their respective default values, this method returns the same result as `get_used_cells`.
A cell is considered empty if its source identifier equals `-1`, its atlas coordinate identifier is `Vector2(-1, -1)` and its alternative identifier is `-1`.

> method get_used_rect() -> Rect2i ; qualifiers=const

Returns a rectangle enclosing the used (non-empty) tiles of the map.

> method has_body_rid(body: RID) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns whether the provided `body` `RID` belongs to one of this `TileMapLayer`'s cells.

> method is_cell_flipped_h(coords: Vector2i) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the cell at coordinates `coords` is flipped horizontally. The result is valid only for atlas sources.

> method is_cell_flipped_v(coords: Vector2i) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the cell at coordinates `coords` is flipped vertically. The result is valid only for atlas sources.

> method is_cell_transposed(coords: Vector2i) -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the cell at coordinates `coords` is transposed. The result is valid only for atlas sources.

> method local_to_map(local_position: Vector2) -> Vector2i ; qualifiers=const

Returns the map coordinates of the cell containing the given `local_position`. If `local_position` is in global coordinates, consider using `Node2D.to_local` before passing it to this method. See also `map_to_local`.

> method map_pattern(position_in_tilemap: Vector2i, coords_in_pattern: Vector2i, pattern: TileMapPattern) -> Vector2i

Returns for the given coordinates `coords_in_pattern` in a `TileMapPattern` the corresponding cell coordinates if the pattern was pasted at the `position_in_tilemap` coordinates (see `set_pattern`). This mapping is required as in half-offset tile shapes, the mapping might not work by calculating `position_in_tile_map + coords_in_pattern`.

> method map_to_local(map_position: Vector2i) -> Vector2 ; qualifiers=const

Returns the centered position of a cell in the `TileMapLayer`'s local coordinate space. To convert the returned value into global coordinates, use `Node2D.to_global`. See also `local_to_map`.
**Note:** This may not correspond to the visual position of the tile, i.e. it ignores the `TileData.texture_origin` property of individual tiles.

> method notify_runtime_tile_data_update() -> void

Notifies the `TileMapLayer` node that calls to `_use_tile_data_runtime_update` or `_tile_data_runtime_update` will lead to different results. This will thus trigger a `TileMapLayer` update.
**Warning:** Updating the `TileMapLayer` is computationally expensive and may impact performance. Try to limit the number of calls to this function to avoid unnecessary update.
**Note:** This does not trigger a direct update of the `TileMapLayer`, the update will be done at the end of the frame as usual (unless you call `update_internals`).

> method set_cell(coords: Vector2i, source_id: int = -1, atlas_coords: Vector2i = Vector2i(-1, -1), alternative_tile: int = 0) -> void

Sets the tile identifiers for the cell at coordinates `coords`. Each tile of the `TileSet` is identified using three parts:
- The source identifier `source_id` identifies a `TileSetSource` identifier. See `TileSet.set_source_id`,
- The atlas coordinate identifier `atlas_coords` identifies a tile coordinates in the atlas (if the source is a `TileSetAtlasSource`). For `TileSetScenesCollectionSource` it should always be `Vector2i(0, 0)`,
- The alternative tile identifier `alternative_tile` identifies a tile alternative in the atlas (if the source is a `TileSetAtlasSource`), and the scene for a `TileSetScenesCollectionSource`.
If `source_id` is set to `-1`, `atlas_coords` to `Vector2i(-1, -1)`, or `alternative_tile` to `-1`, the cell will be erased. An erased cell gets **all** its identifiers automatically set to their respective invalid values, namely `-1`, `Vector2i(-1, -1)` and `-1`.

> method set_cells_terrain_connect(cells: Array[Vector2i], terrain_set: int, terrain: int, ignore_empty_terrains: bool = true) -> void

Update all the cells in the `cells` coordinates array so that they use the given `terrain` for the given `terrain_set`. If an updated cell has the same terrain as one of its neighboring cells, this function tries to join the two. This function might update neighboring tiles if needed to create correct terrain transitions.
If `ignore_empty_terrains` is `true`, empty terrains will be ignored when trying to find the best fitting tile for the given terrain constraints.
**Note:** To work correctly, this method requires the `TileMapLayer`'s TileSet to have terrains set up with all required terrain combinations. Otherwise, it may produce unexpected results.

> method set_cells_terrain_path(path: Array[Vector2i], terrain_set: int, terrain: int, ignore_empty_terrains: bool = true) -> void

Update all the cells in the `path` coordinates array so that they use the given `terrain` for the given `terrain_set`. The function will also connect two successive cell in the path with the same terrain. This function might update neighboring tiles if needed to create correct terrain transitions.
If `ignore_empty_terrains` is `true`, empty terrains will be ignored when trying to find the best fitting tile for the given terrain constraints.
**Note:** To work correctly, this method requires the `TileMapLayer`'s TileSet to have terrains set up with all required terrain combinations. Otherwise, it may produce unexpected results.

> method set_navigation_map(map: RID) -> void

Sets a custom `map` as a `NavigationServer2D` navigation map. If not set, uses the default `World2D` navigation map instead.

> method set_pattern(position: Vector2i, pattern: TileMapPattern) -> void

Pastes the `TileMapPattern` at the given `position` in the tile map. See also `get_pattern`.

> method update_internals() -> void

Triggers a direct update of the `TileMapLayer`. Usually, calling this function is not needed, as `TileMapLayer` node updates automatically when one of its properties or cells is modified.
However, for performance reasons, those updates are batched and delayed to the end of the frame. Calling this function will force the `TileMapLayer` to update right away instead.
**Warning:** Updating the `TileMapLayer` is computationally expensive and may impact performance. Try to limit the number of updates and how many tiles they impact.

## Signals

> signal changed()

Emitted when this `TileMapLayer`'s properties changes. This includes modified cells, properties, or changes made to its assigned `TileSet`.
**Note:** This signal may be emitted very often when batch-modifying a `TileMapLayer`. Avoid executing complex processing in a connected function, and consider delaying it to the end of the frame instead (i.e. calling `Object.call_deferred`).

## Enumerations

> enum DebugVisibilityMode

> enum_value DebugVisibilityMode.DEBUG_VISIBILITY_MODE_DEFAULT = 0

Hide the collisions or navigation debug shapes in the editor, and use the debug settings to determine their visibility in game (i.e. `SceneTree.debug_collisions_hint` or `SceneTree.debug_navigation_hint`).

> enum_value DebugVisibilityMode.DEBUG_VISIBILITY_MODE_FORCE_HIDE = 2

Always hide the collisions or navigation debug shapes.

> enum_value DebugVisibilityMode.DEBUG_VISIBILITY_MODE_FORCE_SHOW = 1

Always show the collisions or navigation debug shapes.
