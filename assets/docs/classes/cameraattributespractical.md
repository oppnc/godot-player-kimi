# CameraAttributesPractical

> class CameraAttributesPractical
> inherits CameraAttributesPractical CameraAttributes

## Brief

Camera settings in an easy to use format.

## Description

Controls camera-specific attributes such as auto-exposure, depth of field, and exposure override.
When used in a `WorldEnvironment` it provides default settings for exposure, auto-exposure, and depth of field that will be used by all cameras without their own `CameraAttributes`, including the editor camera. When used in a `Camera3D` it will override any `CameraAttributes` set in the `WorldEnvironment`. When used in `VoxelGI` or `LightmapGI`, only the exposure settings will be used.
**Note:** Depth of field blur is only supported in the Forward+ and Mobile rendering methods, not Compatibility.
**Note:** Auto-exposure is only supported in the Forward+ rendering method, not Mobile or Compatibility.

## Properties

> property auto_exposure_max_sensitivity : float ; default=800.0 ; setter=set_auto_exposure_max_sensitivity ; getter=get_auto_exposure_max_sensitivity

The maximum sensitivity (in ISO) used when calculating auto exposure. When calculating scene average luminance, color values will be clamped to at least this value. This limits the auto-exposure from exposing below a certain brightness, resulting in a cut off point where the scene will remain bright.

> property auto_exposure_min_sensitivity : float ; default=0.0 ; setter=set_auto_exposure_min_sensitivity ; getter=get_auto_exposure_min_sensitivity

The minimum sensitivity (in ISO) used when calculating auto exposure. When calculating scene average luminance, color values will be clamped to at least this value. This limits the auto-exposure from exposing above a certain brightness, resulting in a cut off point where the scene will remain dark.

> property dof_blur_amount : float ; default=0.1 ; setter=set_dof_blur_amount ; getter=get_dof_blur_amount

Sets the maximum amount of blur. When using physically-based blur amounts, will instead act as a multiplier. High values lead to an increased amount of blurriness, but can be much more expensive to calculate. It is best to keep this as low as possible for a given art style.

> property dof_blur_far_distance : float ; default=10.0 ; setter=set_dof_blur_far_distance ; getter=get_dof_blur_far_distance

Objects further from the `Camera3D` by this amount will be blurred by the depth of field effect. Measured in meters.

> property dof_blur_far_enabled : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_dof_blur_far_enabled ; getter=is_dof_blur_far_enabled

Enables depth of field blur for objects further than `dof_blur_far_distance`. Strength of blur is controlled by `dof_blur_amount` and modulated by `dof_blur_far_transition`.
**Note:** Depth of field blur is only supported in the Forward+ and Mobile rendering methods, not Compatibility.
**Note:** Depth of field blur is not supported on viewports that have a transparent background (where `Viewport.transparent_bg` is `true`).

> property dof_blur_far_transition : float ; default=5.0 ; setter=set_dof_blur_far_transition ; getter=get_dof_blur_far_transition

When positive, distance over which (starting from `dof_blur_far_distance`) blur effect will scale from 0 to `dof_blur_amount`. When negative, uses physically-based scaling so depth of field effect will scale from 0 at `dof_blur_far_distance` and will increase in a physically accurate way as objects get further from the `Camera3D`.

> property dof_blur_near_distance : float ; default=2.0 ; setter=set_dof_blur_near_distance ; getter=get_dof_blur_near_distance

Objects closer from the `Camera3D` by this amount will be blurred by the depth of field effect. Measured in meters.

> property dof_blur_near_enabled : bool ; default=false ; setter=set_dof_blur_near_enabled ; getter=is_dof_blur_near_enabled

Enables depth of field blur for objects closer than `dof_blur_near_distance`. Strength of blur is controlled by `dof_blur_amount` and modulated by `dof_blur_near_transition`.
**Note:** Depth of field blur is only supported in the Forward+ and Mobile rendering methods, not Compatibility.
**Note:** Depth of field blur is not supported on viewports that have a transparent background (where `Viewport.transparent_bg` is `true`).

> property dof_blur_near_transition : float ; default=1.0 ; setter=set_dof_blur_near_transition ; getter=get_dof_blur_near_transition

When positive, distance over which blur effect will scale from 0 to `dof_blur_amount`, ending at `dof_blur_near_distance`. When negative, uses physically-based scaling so depth of field effect will scale from 0 at `dof_blur_near_distance` and will increase in a physically accurate way as objects get closer to the `Camera3D`.
