# VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D

> class VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D
> inherits VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D VisualInstance3D

## Brief

A box-shaped region of 3D space that detects whether it is visible on screen.

## Description

`VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D` represents a box-shaped region of 3D space. When any part of this region becomes visible on screen or in a `Camera3D`'s view, it will emit a `screen_entered` signal, and likewise it will emit a `screen_exited` signal when no part of it remains visible.
If you want a node to be enabled automatically when this region is visible on screen, use `VisibleOnScreenEnabler3D`.
**Note:** `VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D` uses an approximate heuristic that doesn't take walls and other occlusion into account, unless occlusion culling is used. It also won't function unless `Node3D.visible` is set to `true`.

## Properties

> property aabb : AABB ; default=AABB(-1, -1, -1, 2, 2, 2) ; setter=set_aabb ; getter=get_aabb

The `VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D`'s bounding box.

## Methods

> method is_on_screen() -> bool ; qualifiers=const

Returns `true` if the bounding box is on the screen.
**Note:** It takes one frame for the `VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D`'s visibility to be assessed once added to the scene tree, so this method will always return `false` right after it is instantiated.

## Signals

> signal screen_entered()

Emitted when the `VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D` enters the screen.

> signal screen_exited()

Emitted when the `VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D` exits the screen.
